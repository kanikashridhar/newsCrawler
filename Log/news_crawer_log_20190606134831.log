             'at the top  Since Jonny Bairstow displaced Alex Hales at the top '
             'of the England batting order, he and Jason Roy have formed the '

             'balls respectively - 12 fewer than the next best, Shikhar '
             "Dhawan\\'s 95 balls) and collectively, no other opening pair has "
             'scored more runs at the top of the order since 2018.  Of the '
             'likely opening partnerships at the World Cup, Bairstow and Roy '
             'top the list with an average of 58.7, just ahead of Pakistan '
             'pair Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq (57.7). The third best are '
             "India\\'s Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma, who average 45 when "
             'opening together.  ### The most destructive batsman in the '
             'world?  \\n Jos Buttler has scored three ODI hundreds from 60 '
             'balls or fewer  Three of the current England team (Jos Buttler, '
             'Bairstow and Roy) are in the top 10 for batsmen with the highest '
             'strike-rates in one-day history (minimum 1,000 runs).  And only '
             "Australia\\'s Glenn Maxwell stands above Buttler, who averages "
             '119.57 runs per 100 balls faced (Maxwell 121.95).  There is an '
             'argument for saying Buttler is better than Maxwell, however, '
             'since he has scored more runs in his career and at a much better '
             'average (41.54 to 33.33).  Crucially, he has scored eight '
             "centuries to Maxwell\\'s one - the latest his 110 off 55 balls "
             'that demolished Pakistan in Southampton earlier this month.  To '
             "put Buttler\\'s strike-rate of 119.57 in perspective, take a "
             'look at AB de Villiers, regarded as one of the most innovative '
             'and exhilarating batsmen of the past decade. His strike-rate? '

             'their way to success  Once the batsmen have done their work, '
             "it\\'s over to the bowlers.  Much of England\\'s success with "
             'the ball is down to their spin twins: Adil Rashid (leg-spinner) '
             'and Moeen Ali (off-spinner).  And, in Rashid, England have the '
             'most prolific wicket-taker of the past four years in one-day '

             'Kuldeep Yadav (India)| 87      A quick look at the table above '
             "underlines what is needed to be successful in today\\'s "
             'batsman-dominated world: top-class spin bowling or pace.  Just '
             '12 months ago, the latter seemed out of reach for England. Where '
             'would they find a bowler capable of delivering the ball at '
             'speeds in excess of 90mph and with a canny collection of skills '
             'to match?  Step forward Jofra Archer.  The immensely talented '
             'Archer, born in Barbados to a British father, only became '
             'eligible to play for England in March.  Since then, he has '
             'played just three ODIs but has shown enough to persuade England '
             'to promote him into their 15-man World Cup squad at the expense '
             'of David Willey.  Regarded as one of the best white-ball '
             'cricketers in the world, Archer might just prove the final piece '
             "in England\\'s jigsaw.  ### Captain Morgan at the wheel  Pulling "
             'all of this together is Eoin Morgan, the Irishman seen as the '
             'best leader England have had in this form of the game.  "I rate '
             'him as the best captain we\\\'ve had in one-day cricket," said '
             'former captain Michael Vaughan on a recent BBC podcast.  '
             '"He\\\'s a guy who reads play, is ahead of the game and the way '
             'he deals with personalities, he\\\'s a good man-manager.  "All '
             'of the players idolise him. They just feel safe with Morgan as '
             'captain."  \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  ### Who or what can stop '
             'them?  This man...  \\n Virat Kohli has scored more than 10,000 '
             'ODI runs  India captain Virat Kohli is a modern-day legend. '
             'Since the last World Cup, he is the only player to score more '
             "than 4,000 ODI runs - and he\\'s done so at an average of "
             '78.29.  His much-vaunted record in run-chases is eye-watering '
             'too - batting second and in matches India have won (84 in '
             'total), he averages 95.24.  England might be able to post the '
             'biggest of scores... but Kohli will fancy his chances of chasing '
             'them down.  Equally, England came unstuck against Pakistan in '
             'the semi-finals of the 2017 Champions Trophy when they came '
             'across a worn pitch which blunted the effectiveness of their '
             'ball-strikers at the top of the innings.  The ICC, just as in '
             '2017, is in charge of pitch preparation and England could face '
             'similar challenges in the final four or the final.  They are '
             'better prepared two years on, however, and it might well be that '
             'the harsh lesson learned in 2017 will prove valuable this '
             'summer.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'all of this together is Eoin Morgan, the Irishman seen as the '
             'best leader England have had in this form of the game.  "I rate '
             'him as the best captain we\\\'ve had in one-day cricket," said '
             'former captain Michael Vaughan on a recent BBC podcast.  '
             '"He\\\'s a guy who reads play, is ahead of the game and the way '
             'he deals with personalities, he\\\'s a good man-manager.  "All '
             'of the players idolise him. They just feel safe with Morgan as '
             'captain."  \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  ### Who or what can stop '
             'them?  This man...  \\n Virat Kohli has scored more than 10,000 '
             'ODI runs  India captain Virat Kohli is a modern-day legend. '
             'Since the last World Cup, he is the only player to score more '
             "than 4,000 ODI runs - and he\\'s done so at an average of "
             '78.29.  His much-vaunted record in run-chases is eye-watering '
             'too - batting second and in matches India have won (84 in '
             'total), he averages 95.24.  England might be able to post the '
             'biggest of scores... but Kohli will fancy his chances of chasing '
             'them down.  Equally, England came unstuck against Pakistan in '
             'the semi-finals of the 2017 Champions Trophy when they came '
             'across a worn pitch which blunted the effectiveness of their '
             'ball-strikers at the top of the innings.  The ICC, just as in '
             '2017, is in charge of pitch preparation and England could face '
             'similar challenges in the final four or the final.  They are '
             'better prepared two years on, however, and it might well be that '
             'the harsh lesson learned in 2017 will prove valuable this '
             'summer.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'bat has been dominating and the poor bowlers have been afforded '
             'precious little movement from the white ball, bouncers are a '
             'legitimate tactic.  You might ask why this is different to Test '
             'cricket where, if a batsman chooses (and is able to), he ducks '
             'and weaves the bumpers until the bowler gets fed up and tries '
             'something else.  In one-day internationals, the batsman is under '
             'pressure to get on with run- scoring and does not have the '
             'luxury of leaving too many deliveries.  He is almost compelled '
             'to go after the short ball. It is difficult to master the skill '
             'of scoring runs from a 90mph delivery that is dug into your '
             'armpit or is fizzing past your nose.  It remains to be seen if '
             'this trend continues. A lot will depend on pitches and '
             'conditions because on a slow wicket or an overcast day when the '
             'white ball may offer a hint of swing, it would not be a good '
             'idea to be banging it into the middle of the pitch.  If, '
             'however, short-pitched bowling becomes a necessity, England are '
             'well stocked in the shape of Liam Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jofra '
             'Archer.  Along with Ben Stokes, Archer was the standout '
             "performer in England\\'s opening win against South Africa on "
             'Thursday. He took three wickets and rattled the grille of Hashim '
             'Amla, forcing one of the finest players in the game to retire '
             'hurt.  Archer has an incredible talent. He is one of those fast '
             'bowlers who makes it look easy.  You will see others having to '
             'charge in, arms and legs pumping, in order to generate high '
             'speed.  Archer has a loose-limbed approach in a run-up that is '
             'not very long. He gets into a good position at the crease and '
             'releases the ball late from a very high action. He snaps the '
             'ball down at genuine pace.  He has rhythm to his bowling. That '
             'is a hard a thing to define but very difficult to find if it is '
             'not there. It is when everything is working in perfect harmony - '
             'the run-up, action, release and follow-through all click and '
             'flow into one another.  For Archer, it looks like all of that '
             "comes naturally.  \\n Archer hits South Africa\\'s Hashim Amla "
             'on the helmet grille  Not only that, but he is an extremely '
             'relaxed character, one who has taken to international cricket as '
             'easily as anyone I have seen.  That might be because of his '
             'experience in Twenty20 leagues around the world, where he has '
             'become used to playing in front of big crowds and delivering '
             'under pressure.  Should England and their fans be excited about '
             'him? Absolutely they should be, not only for what he might '
             'achieve in the World Cup, but then in Test cricket during the '
             'Ashes and beyond.  While Archer has been bowling with the '
             'unresponsive white ball, it is difficult to know what he might '
             'do with the red version.  However, it is not hard to imagine him '
             'being a handful when he gets the chance to tear in with three '
             'slips and a gully waiting to snaffle an edge.  For years England '
             'have been crying out for genuine pace when they have played away '
             'from home.  Remember the last Ashes in Australia, when they were '
             'simply outgunned? Now, with Archer and hopefully a fully fit '

             'one-day internationals and, when you get into a negative roll '
             'like that, it can be very hard to break free.  Remember, this is '

 'newsText': '\\n \\n Cricket World Cup: Pakistan beat England by 14 runs\\n  '
             '\\n  England batsman Joe Root refused to comment on '
             'conversations with the umpires about the ball after the World '
             'Cup defeat by Pakistan at Trent Bridge.  The umpires spoke to '
             'both teams to warn them not to throw the ball into the turf '
             'unnecessarily.  After he was dismissed, England batsman Jos '
             'Buttler took a close look at the ball on his way back to the '
             'pavilion.  "If I go into it I will say something that will get '
             'me into trouble," said Root. "I\\\'m just going to leave it."  '
             'There are two white balls used in each innings of a one-day '
             'international, one for each end of the field.  Fielding teams '
             'will often throw the ball into the ground as much as they can to '
             'either soften it up so it becomes more difficult for a batsman '
             'to hit, or scuff up one side in the hope it will swing.  '
             'However, umpires will step in if they feel fielders are using '
             'the tactic excessively in a bid to alter the condition of the '
             "ball.  In both innings of Pakistan\\'s 14-run win at Trent "
             'Bridge, the umpires stopped the match to warn captains Eoin '
             'Morgan and Sarfaraz Ahmed that their teams were making the ball '
             'bounce too much when it was thrown in by fielders.  Morgan '
             'explained: "The umpires came to me and seemed to think we were '
             'throwing the ball in on the bounce too much.  \\n Umpire Marais '
             'Erasmus in discussions with Joe Root over the condition of the '

             'and it was relayed back to us during our innings that Pakistan '
             'were doing the exact same thing."  When Buttler was dismissed, '
             'the ball was rolled towards the umpire, across his path as he '
             'made his way back to the dressing room.  He picked it up and '
             'looked at it, then took a closer look before he threw it in the '
             'direction of the umpire.  "When the ball gets hit into the LED '

             'Jos was interested to see if one side was rougher than the '

             'side did manage to alter the condition of the ball, it still '
             'gave the bowlers no assistance in a match that featured a total '
             'of 682 runs - the second-highest aggregate in World Cup '
             'history.  "There was nothing untoward, just a little bit of '
             'gamesmanship," Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 Live.  "It is a trick of '
             'the trade - you get the ball and you fling it one-bounce into '
             'the keeper. There were a few occasions today where the teams '

                 b'ngland - Hafeez - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n \\n Cricket World Cup: England beaten by Pakistan - '
             'highlights\\n  \\n  Mohammad Hafeez hailed a "total team effort" '
             'by Pakistan after their 14-run World Cup win against England.  '
             'Pakistan were all out for just 105 in their opening match with '
             'West Indies but amassed 348-8 at Trent Bridge after being put '
             'into bat, Hafeez making 84.  The 38-year-old, who hit eight '
             'fours and two sixes, was one of five bowlers to take a wicket in '
             'England\\\'s 334-9.  "We needed one winning performance and then '
             'everyone contributed," he said. "It is a very happy dressing '
             'room."  The victory ended a run of 11 defeats for 1992 World Cup '
             'winners Pakistan, who only last month were beaten 4-0 in their '
             'series with England, which contained one match abandoned because '
             'of rain.  West Indies needed only 13.4 overs to beat them last '
             'week, but at the same venue on Monday openers Imam-ul-Haq and '
             'Fakhar Zaman built a solid platform with an opening partnership '
             'of 82 in 14 overs.  The top five contributed 282 between them '
             'before spinner Shadab Khan took 2-63 opening the bowling and '
             'left-arm seamers Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz claimed 2-67 and '
             '3-82 respectively.  "Everyone was believing we could do this. We '
             'were playing good cricket but not winning crucial stages of the '

 'newsText': '\\n \\n Cricket World Cup: England beaten by Pakistan - '
             'highlights\\n  \\n  Mohammad Hafeez hailed a "total team effort" '
             'by Pakistan after their 14-run World Cup win against England.  '
             'Pakistan were all out for just 105 in their opening match with '
             'West Indies but amassed 348-8 at Trent Bridge after being put '
             'into bat, Hafeez making 84.  The 38-year-old, who hit eight '
             'fours and two sixes, was one of five bowlers to take a wicket in '
             'England\\\'s 334-9.  "We needed one winning performance and then '
             'everyone contributed," he said. "It is a very happy dressing '
             'room."  The victory ended a run of 11 defeats for 1992 World Cup '
             'winners Pakistan, who only last month were beaten 4-0 in their '
             'series with England, which contained one match abandoned because '
             'of rain.  West Indies needed only 13.4 overs to beat them last '
             'week, but at the same venue on Monday openers Imam-ul-Haq and '
             'Fakhar Zaman built a solid platform with an opening partnership '
             'of 82 in 14 overs.  The top five contributed 282 between them '
             'before spinner Shadab Khan took 2-63 opening the bowling and '
             'left-arm seamers Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz claimed 2-67 and '
             '3-82 respectively.  "Everyone was believing we could do this. We '
             'were playing good cricket but not winning crucial stages of the '
             'game," Hafeez said.  "Everyone chipped in today and gave '
             'everything which was required to win the game. It was a total '
             'team effort."  Skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed, who struck five fours in '

             'famous victory by winning a low-scoring thriller in the World '
             'Cup at Cardiff.  After a dismal batting collapse by Sri Lanka, '
             'Afghanistan needed a rain- revised target of just 187 from 41 '
             'overs but were beaten by 34 runs.  Afghanistan slipped to 57-5 '
             'in their chase but a partnership of 64 by Najibullah Zadran and '
             'captain Gulbadin Naib gave them hope.  But Nuwan Pradeep '
             'returned and took two quick wickets before Najibullah was run '
             'out by Dimuth Karunaratne for 43.  That left the final pair '
             'needing 42 more to win but Lasith Malinga bowled Hamid Hassan '
             'with a trademark yorker four balls later.  Sri Lanka had earlier '
             'gone from 144-1 to 201 all out - a collapse sparked when '
             'Mohammed Nabi took three wickets in the 22nd over.  Victory '
             "would have been Afghanistan\\'s second at a World Cup and first "
             'against a Test-playing nation at the tournament.  Instead, Sri '
             'Lanka earn their first win of the 2019 World Cup.  ### Bowlers '
             'rescue Sri Lanka in Cardiff  \\n \\n Hazratullah is out after a '
             "magnificent catch from Thisara Perera\\n  \\n  Sri Lanka\\'s "
             'batsmen also failed in their opening match when they were bowled '
             'out for 136 by New Zealand, and at the halfway stage in this '
             'game they were facing a second embarrassing defeat.  But on this '
             'occasion, albeit against lower-quality opposition, their bowlers '
             'rescued them.  They made mistakes at times - bowling 17 extras - '
             'but for the large part they bowled accurately and did not allow '
             'Afghanistan to race away chasing a small target.  Pradeep was '
             'the pick of the bowlers in a career-best 4-31, including the '
             'crucial wicket of Afghanistan skipper Gulbadin, lbw for 23 after '
             'a nervy wait for a review, and the dismissal of all-rounder '
             'Rashid Khan, bowled for two with a perfect delivery that clipped '
             'the off bail.  Malinga was not at his best early on but he '
             'returned and bowled two perfect yorkers, deliveries which he has '
             'repeated many times throughout his 15-year career and proved too '
             "good for Afghanistan\\'s number nine Dawlat Zadran and 10 Hamid "
             'Hassan.  Sri Lanka also produced two excellent pieces of '
             'fielding which proved crucial.  Thisara Perera took an excellent '
             'diving catch at fine leg to dismiss dangerous opener Hazratullah '
             'Zazai for 30 and Karunaratne hit the stumps direct from mid-off '
             'to run out Najibullah.  \\n \\n Nabi takes three wickets in a '
             'single stunning over\\n  \\n  ### Missed opportunity for '
             'Afghanistan  The result will be even more disappointing for '
             'Afghanistan, given the way they had dragged themselves back into '
             'the game and how Sri Lanka had crumbled with the bat.  Early on '
             'Afghanistan were ill-disciplined, with a number of misfields and '
             'wayward bowling - 17 of the first 52 runs were extras, and Sri '
             'Lanka were allowed to reach 92-0 from 13 overs and 144-1 from '
             '21.  The 17th over lasted 10 balls and cost 19 runs, Afghanistan '
             'captain Gulbadin Naib bowling two no balls and two wides.  \\n '
             '\\n Kusal Perera smashes the ball away to reach fifty\\n  \\n  '
             'But the innings changed when opener Lahiru Thirimanne played on '
             'to Nabi in the 22nd over before Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews '
             'then both edged their second balls to slip within the rest of '
             "the off-spinner\\'s over.  Sri Lanka\\'s batting then became "
             'increasingly hair-brained. Big-hitting number seven Thisara '
             'pushed the ball straight to extra cover, set off for a single '
             'and was run out and Isuru Udana foolishly tried to slog a ball '
             'for six and was bowled.  The game was then halted for almost '
             'three hours because of rain but after the resumption Afghanistan '
             'quickly finished off the Sri Lanka innings.  In reply, '
             'Hazratullah tried to take the attack to Sri Lanka early but, '
             'after he fell, they lost wickets regularly with only Gulbadin '
             'and Najibullah offering resistance.  Najibullah had batted well '
             'but fell trying to keep the strike with a single off the final '
             'ball of the 32nd over.  Afghanistan may well look back on the '
             'extras conceded with the ball as crucial - they conceded 35 and '
             "lost by 34 runs.  ### \\'You can\\'t help but feel sorry for "
             "Afghanistan\\' - reaction  \\n \\n A string of extraordinary "
             'fielding errors gifts Afghanistan a boundary\\n  \\n   **Former '
             'Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O\\\'Brien on TMS:** "You can\\\'t '
             'help but feel a little sorry for Afghanistan. They were so good '
             'for large parts but the class, the experience of Malinga and co '
             '- I thought the Sri Lanka bowlers were excellent. Unfortunately '
             "for Afghanistan they never really got going in the chase. It\\'s "
             'been a wonderful game of cricket."   **Afghanistan captain '
             'Gulbadin Naib:** "We lost the momentum because they scored 100 '
             'runs early on.  "In the middle overs, we thought they would '
             'score 300-plus, so credit to Nabi for his spell there.  "Credit '
             'though should also go to the Sri Lanka bowlers for how well they '
             'bowled. The target was not too much - we prepared for that in '
             'the last few months - but we were missing something."   **Sri '
             'Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne:** "We had a good start but '
             "suddenly we lost a couple of wickets. That\\'s the negative part "
             'but otherwise bowling and fielding was a high note.  "After '
             "losing the first game, it\\'s not easy. You have to keep your "
             'mind positive. We have experience in these conditions."  \\n '

             'rescued them.  They made mistakes at times - bowling 17 extras - '
             'but for the large part they bowled accurately and did not allow '
             'Afghanistan to race away chasing a small target.  Pradeep was '
             'the pick of the bowlers in a career-best 4-31, including the '
             'crucial wicket of Afghanistan skipper Gulbadin, lbw for 23 after '
             'a nervy wait for a review, and the dismissal of all-rounder '
             'Rashid Khan, bowled for two with a perfect delivery that clipped '
             'the off bail.  Malinga was not at his best early on but he '
             'returned and bowled two perfect yorkers, deliveries which he has '
             'repeated many times throughout his 15-year career and proved too '
             "good for Afghanistan\\'s number nine Dawlat Zadran and 10 Hamid "
             'Hassan.  Sri Lanka also produced two excellent pieces of '
             'fielding which proved crucial.  Thisara Perera took an excellent '
             'diving catch at fine leg to dismiss dangerous opener Hazratullah '
             'Zazai for 30 and Karunaratne hit the stumps direct from mid-off '
             'to run out Najibullah.  \\n \\n Nabi takes three wickets in a '
             'single stunning over\\n  \\n  ### Missed opportunity for '
             'Afghanistan  The result will be even more disappointing for '
             'Afghanistan, given the way they had dragged themselves back into '
             'the game and how Sri Lanka had crumbled with the bat.  Early on '
             'Afghanistan were ill-disciplined, with a number of misfields and '
             'wayward bowling - 17 of the first 52 runs were extras, and Sri '
             'Lanka were allowed to reach 92-0 from 13 overs and 144-1 from '
             '21.  The 17th over lasted 10 balls and cost 19 runs, Afghanistan '
             'captain Gulbadin Naib bowling two no balls and two wides.  \\n '
             '\\n Kusal Perera smashes the ball away to reach fifty\\n  \\n  '
             'But the innings changed when opener Lahiru Thirimanne played on '
             'to Nabi in the 22nd over before Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews '
             'then both edged their second balls to slip within the rest of '
             "the off-spinner\\'s over.  Sri Lanka\\'s batting then became "
             'increasingly hair-brained. Big-hitting number seven Thisara '
             'pushed the ball straight to extra cover, set off for a single '
             'and was run out and Isuru Udana foolishly tried to slog a ball '
             'for six and was bowled.  The game was then halted for almost '
             'three hours because of rain but after the resumption Afghanistan '
             'quickly finished off the Sri Lanka innings.  In reply, '
             'Hazratullah tried to take the attack to Sri Lanka early but, '
             'after he fell, they lost wickets regularly with only Gulbadin '
             'and Najibullah offering resistance.  Najibullah had batted well '
             'but fell trying to keep the strike with a single off the final '
             'ball of the 32nd over.  Afghanistan may well look back on the '
             'extras conceded with the ball as crucial - they conceded 35 and '
             "lost by 34 runs.  ### \\'You can\\'t help but feel sorry for "
             "Afghanistan\\' - reaction  \\n \\n A string of extraordinary "
             'fielding errors gifts Afghanistan a boundary\\n  \\n   **Former '
             'Ireland wicketkeeper Niall O\\\'Brien on TMS:** "You can\\\'t '
             'help but feel a little sorry for Afghanistan. They were so good '
             'for large parts but the class, the experience of Malinga and co '
             '- I thought the Sri Lanka bowlers were excellent. Unfortunately '
             "for Afghanistan they never really got going in the chase. It\\'s "
             'been a wonderful game of cricket."   **Afghanistan captain '
             'Gulbadin Naib:** "We lost the momentum because they scored 100 '
             'runs early on.  "In the middle overs, we thought they would '
             'score 300-plus, so credit to Nabi for his spell there.  "Credit '
             'though should also go to the Sri Lanka bowlers for how well they '
             'bowled. The target was not too much - we prepared for that in '
             'the last few months - but we were missing something."   **Sri '
             'Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne:** "We had a good start but '
             "suddenly we lost a couple of wickets. That\\'s the negative part "
             'but otherwise bowling and fielding was a high note.  "After '
             "losing the first game, it\\'s not easy. You have to keep your "
             'mind positive. We have experience in these conditions."  \\n '

 'newsHeadline': b'2019 World Cup: London Stadium not one of 11 tournament venu'
                 b'es - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': "\\n \\n Morgan \\'not terribly disappointed\\' by London Stadium "
             'omission\\n  \\n  London Stadium will not host any World Cup '
             'matches next summer.  The England and Wales Cricket Board was '
             'considering high-capacity venues to host the 50-over competition '
             'in 2019, but the home of West Ham is not one of the 11 grounds '
             "named.  Lord\\'s will host the final on 14 July, while the "
             'semi-finals will be played at Old Trafford and Edgbaston.  '
             'England play the first match of the tournament against South '
             'Africa at The Oval on 30 May.  Australia begin their title '
             'defence in a day-night match against Afghanistan on 1 June in '
             'Bristol.  The tournament, which features 10 teams playing nine '
             'round-robin matches, runs from 30 May to 14 July.  The '
             '60,000-seat London Stadium is much larger than any UK cricket '
             "ground - Lord\\'s has the highest capacity of the World Cup "
             'venues with 30,000 seats.  The former Olympic Stadium was '
             'considered at the request of the International Cricket Council '
             '(ICC), who wanted to replicate the 2015 World Cup in Australia '
             'and New Zealand, which saw games held at large stadiums.  Steve '
             "Elworthy, the tournament\\'s managing director, said they had "
             'done studies for 18 months to see what would be required to turn '
             'that venue into a cricket facility.  "I think the unique '
             'elements of what cricket needs, and what cricket wants, is a '
             'step too far," Elworthy told BBC Sport.  "Cricket hasn\\\'t been '
             'played there before. It was a tough decision but, I think, the '
             'right one."  England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said London '
             'Stadium\\\'s omission was "not terribly disappointing".  "We '
             "haven\\'t played there before, an element of unpredictability "
             'might have crept in with no previous record at the ground," he '
             'said.  Four of the teams, England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and '
             'India, will not play any of the seven day-night matches, while '
             'New Zealand feature in four of them.  India will take on '
             'Pakistan at Old Trafford in Manchester, which is set to host six '
             'matches, on 16 June, while Bangladesh will feature in one of '
             'three matches at Taunton in Somerset.  "Because of the UK\\\'s '
             'diverse population, every competing team will also be guaranteed '
             'a \\\'home crowd\\\' every time they play," Elworthy added.  '
             'More than 80,000 tickets are priced at £20, while child tickets '
             'for every match begin at £6.  England have never won a global '
             '50-over competition, although they were beaten finalists in '
             '1979, 1987 and 1992.  Afghanistan and West Indies beat Ireland '
             'and Scotland respectively to claim the final two places in next '
             "year\\'s tournament.   **2019 Cricket World Cup venues:** "
             'Bristol, Cardiff, Chester-le-Street, Edgbaston (Birmingham), '
             "Headingley (Leeds), Lord\\'s (London), Old Trafford "
             '(Manchester), The Oval (London), Taunton, Trent Bridge '
             '(Nottingham), Southampton.  ### ICC extends Twenty20 '
             'internationals - and replaces 2021 Champions Trophy  Among other '
             'announcements made by the ICC after its board meeting on '
             'Thursday:    * All Twenty20 matches between ICC members - full '

                 b'es - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': "\\n \\n Morgan \\'not terribly disappointed\\' by London Stadium "
             'omission\\n  \\n  London Stadium will not host any World Cup '
             'matches next summer.  The England and Wales Cricket Board was '
             'considering high-capacity venues to host the 50-over competition '
             'in 2019, but the home of West Ham is not one of the 11 grounds '
             "named.  Lord\\'s will host the final on 14 July, while the "
             'semi-finals will be played at Old Trafford and Edgbaston.  '
             'England play the first match of the tournament against South '
             'Africa at The Oval on 30 May.  Australia begin their title '
             'defence in a day-night match against Afghanistan on 1 June in '
             'Bristol.  The tournament, which features 10 teams playing nine '
             'round-robin matches, runs from 30 May to 14 July.  The '
             '60,000-seat London Stadium is much larger than any UK cricket '
             "ground - Lord\\'s has the highest capacity of the World Cup "
             'venues with 30,000 seats.  The former Olympic Stadium was '
             'considered at the request of the International Cricket Council '
             '(ICC), who wanted to replicate the 2015 World Cup in Australia '
             'and New Zealand, which saw games held at large stadiums.  Steve '
             "Elworthy, the tournament\\'s managing director, said they had "
             'done studies for 18 months to see what would be required to turn '
             'that venue into a cricket facility.  "I think the unique '
             'elements of what cricket needs, and what cricket wants, is a '
             'step too far," Elworthy told BBC Sport.  "Cricket hasn\\\'t been '
             'played there before. It was a tough decision but, I think, the '
             'right one."  England one-day captain Eoin Morgan said London '
             'Stadium\\\'s omission was "not terribly disappointing".  "We '
             "haven\\'t played there before, an element of unpredictability "
             'might have crept in with no previous record at the ground," he '
             'said.  Four of the teams, England, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and '
             'India, will not play any of the seven day-night matches, while '
             'New Zealand feature in four of them.  India will take on '
             'Pakistan at Old Trafford in Manchester, which is set to host six '
             'matches, on 16 June, while Bangladesh will feature in one of '
             'three matches at Taunton in Somerset.  "Because of the UK\\\'s '
             'diverse population, every competing team will also be guaranteed '
             'a \\\'home crowd\\\' every time they play," Elworthy added.  '
             'More than 80,000 tickets are priced at £20, while child tickets '
             'for every match begin at £6.  England have never won a global '
             '50-over competition, although they were beaten finalists in '
             '1979, 1987 and 1992.  Afghanistan and West Indies beat Ireland '
             'and Scotland respectively to claim the final two places in next '
             "year\\'s tournament.   **2019 Cricket World Cup venues:** "
             'Bristol, Cardiff, Chester-le-Street, Edgbaston (Birmingham), '
             "Headingley (Leeds), Lord\\'s (London), Old Trafford "
             '(Manchester), The Oval (London), Taunton, Trent Bridge '
             '(Nottingham), Southampton.  ### ICC extends Twenty20 '
             'internationals - and replaces 2021 Champions Trophy  Among other '
             'announcements made by the ICC after its board meeting on '
             'Thursday:    * All Twenty20 matches between ICC members - full '
             'and associate - will be accorded T20 international status from 1 '
             "July 2018 in women\\'s cricket, and 1 January 2019 in men\\'s "
             'cricket. The latter date is the cut-off point for qualification '
             'for the ICC World Twenty20 in 2020   * The planned ICC Champions '
             'Trophy in 2021 will be replaced by another World T20 - the '
             'second in successive years, after the 2020 event - and will be '
             'hosted by India   * ICC chief executive David Richardson says '
             'tougher punishments for player behaviour, such as '
             'ball-tampering, abuse and time-wasting, will be announced in '
             'June and July  \\n',

 'newsText': '\\n George Bartlett hit 19 fours and one six in his innings of '
             '137   **Specsavers County Championship Division One, Guildford '
             '(day one)**   ---    **Somerset 344:** Bartlett 137; Morkel '
             '4-64    **Surrey 0-0**    _Surrey (3 pts) trail Somerset (3 pts) '
             "by 344 runs_   Scorecard      George Bartlett\\'s career-best "
             '137 helped Somerset recover from a top-order collapse on day one '
             'of their match against Surrey at Guildford.  The 21-year-old '
             'came to the crease with his side wobbling on 35-3, but batted '
             'for more than four hours to bring up his third first-class '
             'hundred.  Tom Banton (44), Steve Davies (41) and Craig Overton '
             "(40) provided support.  But Bartlett\\'s wicket saw Somerset "
             'stutter from 298-5 to 344 all out before Surrey saw out two '
             'overs.  It was a disappointing final hour for the visitors, who '
             'went into the match seven points behind Division One leaders '
             'Hampshire with a game in hand.  However, they are still likely '
             'to be pleased with their first-innings total after opener Azhar '
             'Ali withdrew with a throat infection and Lewis Gregory missed '
             'out through injury.  When Marcus Trescothick, Tom Abell and '
             'James Hildreth all went early, Bartlett shared stands of 95 with '
             'both fellow youngster Banton and wicketkeeper Davies and 73 with '
             "Overton.  Surrey\\'s South African paceman Morne Morkel "
             'eventually enticed Bartlett to nick behind and then cleaned up '
             'the tail to finish with 4-64.  Rory Burns and Mark Stoneman saw '
             'out a maiden apiece before stumps to make sure the opening day '
             'ended just about even.   **Surrey bowling coach Richard Johnson '
             'told BBC Radio London:**  "We would have settled for that. We '
             'bowled really well. Batsmen get real value for their shots here '
             'and even good balls can go for four.  "Perhaps we had an '
             'opportunity to get them out for fewer than they got and we were '
             'a bit unlucky at times.  "But, to be fair, they batted well in '
             'the afternoon when it got a bit easier."   **Somerset centurion '
             'George Bartlett:**  "I had a let-off early on and I was pleased '

 'newsHeadline': b"County Championship: Somerset's George Bartlett hits 137 aga"
                 b'inst Surrey - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n George Bartlett hit 19 fours and one six in his innings of '
             '137   **Specsavers County Championship Division One, Guildford '
             '(day one)**   ---    **Somerset 344:** Bartlett 137; Morkel '
             '4-64    **Surrey 0-0**    _Surrey (3 pts) trail Somerset (3 pts) '
             "by 344 runs_   Scorecard      George Bartlett\\'s career-best "
             '137 helped Somerset recover from a top-order collapse on day one '
             'of their match against Surrey at Guildford.  The 21-year-old '
             'came to the crease with his side wobbling on 35-3, but batted '
             'for more than four hours to bring up his third first-class '
             'hundred.  Tom Banton (44), Steve Davies (41) and Craig Overton '
             "(40) provided support.  But Bartlett\\'s wicket saw Somerset "
             'stutter from 298-5 to 344 all out before Surrey saw out two '
             'overs.  It was a disappointing final hour for the visitors, who '
             'went into the match seven points behind Division One leaders '
             'Hampshire with a game in hand.  However, they are still likely '
             'to be pleased with their first-innings total after opener Azhar '
             'Ali withdrew with a throat infection and Lewis Gregory missed '
             'out through injury.  When Marcus Trescothick, Tom Abell and '
             'James Hildreth all went early, Bartlett shared stands of 95 with '
             'both fellow youngster Banton and wicketkeeper Davies and 73 with '
             "Overton.  Surrey\\'s South African paceman Morne Morkel "
             'eventually enticed Bartlett to nick behind and then cleaned up '
             'the tail to finish with 4-64.  Rory Burns and Mark Stoneman saw '
             'out a maiden apiece before stumps to make sure the opening day '
             'ended just about even.   **Surrey bowling coach Richard Johnson '
             'told BBC Radio London:**  "We would have settled for that. We '
             'bowled really well. Batsmen get real value for their shots here '
             'and even good balls can go for four.  "Perhaps we had an '
             'opportunity to get them out for fewer than they got and we were '
             'a bit unlucky at times.  "But, to be fair, they batted well in '
             'the afternoon when it got a bit easier."   **Somerset centurion '
             'George Bartlett:**  "I had a let-off early on and I was pleased '
             'to make the most of it. We just had to get through the new ball. '
             'But you can score runs quickly at Guildford because the outfield '
             'is very fast and the pitch did get better to bat on.  "I was '
             "delighted to cash in. It\\'s my second hundred of the season and "

             'More than 40 overs were lost as Surrey closed on 188-5, 156 '
             'behind Somerset.  Surrey had been 38-3, but England wicketkeeper '
             "Ben Foakes\\' 57 steadied things, before rain arrived shortly "
             'after lunch with the hosts on 123-4.  Play resumed at 17:30 BST '
             'when Craig Overton claimed the wicket of Scott Borthwick (36) to '
             'leave Somerset just on top against the defending champions.  '
             "Overton\\'s twin brother Jamie also took two wickets, removing "
             'Foakes, caught behind following a loose drive.  Resuming on 0-0 '
             "after seeing out the first day\\'s final two overs, Mark "
             'Stoneman, captain Rory Burns and South Africa batsman Dean Elgar '
             'all went cheaply in the first hour.  Foakes counter-attacked and '
             'hit 10 fours in his 70-ball knock, but once again failed to go '
             'on and get a big score.  The 26-year-old, who will be looking to '
             'add to five Test caps against Australia later this summer, has '
             'made 268 runs in nine first-class innings in 2019 with a top '
             'score of 69.  When Borthwick was out to an excellent diving '
             'catch by Steven Davies, Ryan Patel (40 not out) and Will Jacks '
             'saw out the final 10 overs without further damage.   **Surrey '
             'batsman Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London:**  "It\\\'s the sort '
             'of pitch where there is still something in it for the bowlers, '
             'although with the fast outfield here you are always in the game '
             'too as a batsman.  "It was one of those situations where I never '
             'really felt in, but you just have to apply yourself as best as '
             'you can.  "The guys did well in that last little session, and '
             'losing only one wicket in it was a great effort. Hopefully, both '
             'Ryan Patel and Will Jacks can cash in."   **Somerset fast bowler '
             'Craig Overton:**  "The game is still finely balanced, although I '
             'would say it is about 60-40 in our favour at the moment.  "There '
             'is still a bit in it for the bowlers, but there is a long way to '
             'go in the match.  "It was good to have Jamie back in the team as '
             'he adds a different dimension to our attack."  \\n',

             'against Somerset following a rain-hit second day at Guildford.  '
             'More than 40 overs were lost as Surrey closed on 188-5, 156 '
             'behind Somerset.  Surrey had been 38-3, but England wicketkeeper '
             "Ben Foakes\\' 57 steadied things, before rain arrived shortly "
             'after lunch with the hosts on 123-4.  Play resumed at 17:30 BST '
             'when Craig Overton claimed the wicket of Scott Borthwick (36) to '
             'leave Somerset just on top against the defending champions.  '
             "Overton\\'s twin brother Jamie also took two wickets, removing "
             'Foakes, caught behind following a loose drive.  Resuming on 0-0 '
             "after seeing out the first day\\'s final two overs, Mark "
             'Stoneman, captain Rory Burns and South Africa batsman Dean Elgar '
             'all went cheaply in the first hour.  Foakes counter-attacked and '
             'hit 10 fours in his 70-ball knock, but once again failed to go '
             'on and get a big score.  The 26-year-old, who will be looking to '
             'add to five Test caps against Australia later this summer, has '
             'made 268 runs in nine first-class innings in 2019 with a top '
             'score of 69.  When Borthwick was out to an excellent diving '
             'catch by Steven Davies, Ryan Patel (40 not out) and Will Jacks '
             'saw out the final 10 overs without further damage.   **Surrey '
             'batsman Ben Foakes told BBC Radio London:**  "It\\\'s the sort '
             'of pitch where there is still something in it for the bowlers, '
             'although with the fast outfield here you are always in the game '
             'too as a batsman.  "It was one of those situations where I never '
             'really felt in, but you just have to apply yourself as best as '
             'you can.  "The guys did well in that last little session, and '
             'losing only one wicket in it was a great effort. Hopefully, both '
             'Ryan Patel and Will Jacks can cash in."   **Somerset fast bowler '
             'Craig Overton:**  "The game is still finely balanced, although I '
             'would say it is about 60-40 in our favour at the moment.  "There '
             'is still a bit in it for the bowlers, but there is a long way to '
             'go in the match.  "It was good to have Jamie back in the team as '
             'he adds a different dimension to our attack."  \\n',

                 b'BC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n \\n  We kick off our Sri Lanka one-day international series '
             "on Saturday. It\\'s not that long since we were out here last - "
             "it was when we secured qualification for the 2017 ICC Women\\'s "
             "World Cup, and hopefully we\\'ll be able to replicate that "
             "series result.  We feel in a good place at the minute. We\\'ve "
             "got cricket behind us and we\\'re in the habit of winning - "
             "having come out on top in our past four games - and we\\'ll hope "
             'to use that in this series.  Sri Lanka are a good side, though, '
             'and we would never underestimate them. Their form of late has '
             'been decent, with some impressive showings against India and '
             "South Africa, so they\\'ll go into the series with a bit of "
             'belief.  We have to control what we can control and play our '
             "best cricket. We\\'ve got a lot of talented cricketers in this "
             "dressing room who\\'ll all be keen to show what they can do "
             "across this series.  ### Learning from India  It\\'s nice to "
             "have a bit of momentum behind us. We didn\\'t start the India "
             "tour how we wanted - and obviously we didn\\'t get the ODI "
             'series result we went there to get - but I was happy with how we '
             'came back from that.  We probably could have done with more '
             "preparation in India. It\\'s so difficult because time is always "
             'a factor - and this was always going to be a long tour - but '
             "increasingly in the women\\'s game, I think you\\'ll see two "
             "warm-up games becoming the norm.  We don\\'t want to use that as "
             'an excuse, though. It was massively disappointing because we '

 'newsText': '\\n \\n  We kick off our Sri Lanka one-day international series '
             "on Saturday. It\\'s not that long since we were out here last - "
             "it was when we secured qualification for the 2017 ICC Women\\'s "
             "World Cup, and hopefully we\\'ll be able to replicate that "
             "series result.  We feel in a good place at the minute. We\\'ve "
             "got cricket behind us and we\\'re in the habit of winning - "
             "having come out on top in our past four games - and we\\'ll hope "
             'to use that in this series.  Sri Lanka are a good side, though, '
             'and we would never underestimate them. Their form of late has '
             'been decent, with some impressive showings against India and '
             "South Africa, so they\\'ll go into the series with a bit of "
             'belief.  We have to control what we can control and play our '
             "best cricket. We\\'ve got a lot of talented cricketers in this "

             "across this series.  ### Learning from India  It\\'s nice to "
             "have a bit of momentum behind us. We didn\\'t start the India "
             "tour how we wanted - and obviously we didn\\'t get the ODI "
             'series result we went there to get - but I was happy with how we '
             'came back from that.  We probably could have done with more '
             "preparation in India. It\\'s so difficult because time is always "
             'a factor - and this was always going to be a long tour - but '
             "increasingly in the women\\'s game, I think you\\'ll see two "
             "warm-up games becoming the norm.  We don\\'t want to use that as "
             'an excuse, though. It was massively disappointing because we '

             'England players have been ready to go for a couple of weeks, '
             "since the Pakistan series ended.  Still, even though it\\'s such "
             'a massive occasion, that morning will be like any other. When '
             'the game starts, the lads will be fired up, but the early part '
             'of the day, when we first get to the ground, will be quite '
             'chilled out.  Mark Saxby, the team masseur, is like the '
             'heartbeat of the dressing room. He sorts the drinks, puts daft '
             'things on the wall and chooses the music.  So often, he gets the '
             'mood just right. One day it might be calypso tunes, another some '
             'Oasis and indie, another some rap.  Me, Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes '
             "and Jonny Bairstow will be in the physio\\'s room getting "
             'strapped up. Eoin Morgan and Joe Root will be trying to get into '
             'their batting bubble.  It might not seem like it to the public, '
             "but Moeen Ali is always up to no good. He\\'ll probably be "
             'playing a prank on someone.  The noise? That probably comes from '
             "me. There\\'s an episode of Friends where Ross makes the \\'keep "
             "it down\\' sign. I sit next to Woakesy, and that\\'s what he "
             'does to me.  Before then, there will be training on Wednesday '
             'and a meeting on what to expect from South Africa.  When we have '
             'downtime, we do what we can to not think about cricket. I might '
             "go for a coffee with Woakes and Plunkett (I don\\'t actually "
             'drink coffee, but just go for the banter) and I bet Plunkett '
             'will be getting his beard trimmed to look good for the TV '
             'cameras.  A few of us will probably find somewhere to watch the '
             "Europa League final, and you\\'ll often find plenty of the lads "
             "in Root\\'s room, because he has Mario Kart and Mario Tennis "
             "Aces set up. I\\'m undefeated on the tennis, ranked number one.  "
             '\\n Mark Wood has taken 43 wickets in 41 one-day matches for '
             'England  For me, there was the moment of panic in the match '
             'against Australia at Southampton on Saturday when I thought this '
             'all might be taken away.  My history with left ankle injuries is '
             'well documented, but the worry this time was that it felt '
             'different - a pain when I was running, rather than when I was '
             'bowling.  Jos Buttler, standing in as captain, took no chances. '
             'We knew it was only a warm-up game, so we were extra cautious.  '
             'When I left the field so quickly, it probably looked worse than '
             "it was and, when I got off, the medical staff couldn\\'t see a "
             'glaring issue.  They sent me for a scan and, when the results '
             'came back, it was the best news it could have been - just a '
             "little swelling of the joint.  So, since the weekend, I\\'ve "
             'been living on an ice machine. The rest of the squad have one '
             'between them but, because I use one so often, I bought my own. '
             "It\\'s even got my name on so everyone else knows not to use "
             'it.  I bowled at 100% on Tuesday and felt no problems, so I can '
             'put my name in the hat to be considered for selection on '
             'Thursday.  And so, here I am, fulfilling a dream of playing in a '
             "World Cup.  \\n Mark Wood has been passed fit for England\\'s "
             "World Cup opener against South Africa  I\\'ll be honest, the "
             "past few weeks are the most nervous I\\'ve ever been about "
             'selection, both before the Pakistan series and then for the '
             'World Cup squad, because I played only one of the five games.  I '
             'was thinking that, with Jofra Archer around and capable of '
             'bowling over 90mph, they might go for a like-for-like swap and I '
             "would be the one to miss out.  In the past, I haven\\'t had "
             "national selector Ed Smith\\'s phone number saved, so I didn\\'t "
             "know when he was calling. Now, it\\'s locked into my contacts.  "
             'On that Monday afternoon, I was watching TV with my wife. When '
             "you see his name flash up, it\\'s an \\'oh my God\\' moment, "
             'because you know you could get some very, very good or very, '
             'very bad news.  I dived into a quiet room and started pacing. I '
             'was delighted to be picked, but it was a bittersweet feeling '
             'when I learned that David Willey and Joe Denly had been left '
             "out. We\\'ve been such a tight group and I was particularly "
             'disappointed for Dave.  Now, though, the overriding feeling is '
             "excitement. That\\'s genuine and shared by every player.  Do you "
             'allow yourself that tiny moment of thinking what it would be '
             "like to lift the World Cup at Lord\\'s on 14 July?  Maybe, but "
             "so much hard work goes in first. If we do what we\\'ve been "
             'doing for the past four years, results will take care of '
             "themselves. It\\'s important not to look past the things that "
             'have served us well, rather than dreaming too big.  What you can '
             'do is think back to last summer, when it was scorching hot and '
             'everyone was so into the football World Cup - people partying in '
             'parks up and down the country as England made the semi-finals.  '

             'chilled out.  Mark Saxby, the team masseur, is like the '
             'heartbeat of the dressing room. He sorts the drinks, puts daft '
             'things on the wall and chooses the music.  So often, he gets the '
             'mood just right. One day it might be calypso tunes, another some '
             'Oasis and indie, another some rap.  Me, Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes '
             "and Jonny Bairstow will be in the physio\\'s room getting "
             'strapped up. Eoin Morgan and Joe Root will be trying to get into '
             'their batting bubble.  It might not seem like it to the public, '
             "but Moeen Ali is always up to no good. He\\'ll probably be "
             'playing a prank on someone.  The noise? That probably comes from '
             "me. There\\'s an episode of Friends where Ross makes the \\'keep "
             "it down\\' sign. I sit next to Woakesy, and that\\'s what he "
             'does to me.  Before then, there will be training on Wednesday '
             'and a meeting on what to expect from South Africa.  When we have '
             'downtime, we do what we can to not think about cricket. I might '
             "go for a coffee with Woakes and Plunkett (I don\\'t actually "
             'drink coffee, but just go for the banter) and I bet Plunkett '
             'will be getting his beard trimmed to look good for the TV '
             'cameras.  A few of us will probably find somewhere to watch the '
             "Europa League final, and you\\'ll often find plenty of the lads "
             "in Root\\'s room, because he has Mario Kart and Mario Tennis "
             "Aces set up. I\\'m undefeated on the tennis, ranked number one.  "
             '\\n Mark Wood has taken 43 wickets in 41 one-day matches for '
             'England  For me, there was the moment of panic in the match '
             'against Australia at Southampton on Saturday when I thought this '
             'all might be taken away.  My history with left ankle injuries is '
             'well documented, but the worry this time was that it felt '
             'different - a pain when I was running, rather than when I was '
             'bowling.  Jos Buttler, standing in as captain, took no chances. '
             'We knew it was only a warm-up game, so we were extra cautious.  '
             'When I left the field so quickly, it probably looked worse than '
             "it was and, when I got off, the medical staff couldn\\'t see a "
             'glaring issue.  They sent me for a scan and, when the results '
             'came back, it was the best news it could have been - just a '
             "little swelling of the joint.  So, since the weekend, I\\'ve "
             'been living on an ice machine. The rest of the squad have one '
             'between them but, because I use one so often, I bought my own. '
             "It\\'s even got my name on so everyone else knows not to use "
             'it.  I bowled at 100% on Tuesday and felt no problems, so I can '
             'put my name in the hat to be considered for selection on '
             'Thursday.  And so, here I am, fulfilling a dream of playing in a '
             "World Cup.  \\n Mark Wood has been passed fit for England\\'s "
             "World Cup opener against South Africa  I\\'ll be honest, the "
             "past few weeks are the most nervous I\\'ve ever been about "
             'selection, both before the Pakistan series and then for the '
             'World Cup squad, because I played only one of the five games.  I '
             'was thinking that, with Jofra Archer around and capable of '
             'bowling over 90mph, they might go for a like-for-like swap and I '
             "would be the one to miss out.  In the past, I haven\\'t had "
             "national selector Ed Smith\\'s phone number saved, so I didn\\'t "
             "know when he was calling. Now, it\\'s locked into my contacts.  "
             'On that Monday afternoon, I was watching TV with my wife. When '
             "you see his name flash up, it\\'s an \\'oh my God\\' moment, "
             'because you know you could get some very, very good or very, '
             'very bad news.  I dived into a quiet room and started pacing. I '
             'was delighted to be picked, but it was a bittersweet feeling '
             'when I learned that David Willey and Joe Denly had been left '
             "out. We\\'ve been such a tight group and I was particularly "
             'disappointed for Dave.  Now, though, the overriding feeling is '
             "excitement. That\\'s genuine and shared by every player.  Do you "
             'allow yourself that tiny moment of thinking what it would be '
             "like to lift the World Cup at Lord\\'s on 14 July?  Maybe, but "
             "so much hard work goes in first. If we do what we\\'ve been "
             'doing for the past four years, results will take care of '
             "themselves. It\\'s important not to look past the things that "
             'have served us well, rather than dreaming too big.  What you can '
             'do is think back to last summer, when it was scorching hot and '
             'everyone was so into the football World Cup - people partying in '
             'parks up and down the country as England made the semi-finals.  '
             "Wouldn\\'t it be brilliant to get cricket on the back pages of "

                 b'ul Farbrace on their survival - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '_Download and listen to the full interviews with Trevor Bayliss '
             'and Paul Farbrace, available as a_Test Match Special podcast.  '
             '\\n \\n \\n Paul Farbrace (left) and Trevor Bayliss (middle) '
             'joined Sri Lanka in 2007  On 3 March 2009, the Sri Lanka cricket '
             'team were in Lahore, Pakistan. It was the third morning of '
             'another Test match. Shortly before 09:00 local time, just '
             'outside the Gaddafi Stadium, 12 gunmen ambushed them.  Six '
             'policemen and a driver escorting match officials were killed. '
             'The attackers were armed with assault rifles, grenades and '
             'rocket launchers.  England coach Trevor Bayliss and his '
             'assistant Paul Farbrace, both then working with Sri Lanka, were '
             'on the team bus. Here, 10 years on, they explain how they '
             'survived.  \\n \\n  **Farbrace:** We were quite a superstitious '
             'team. We always had the same seats in the bus. I was always '
             'three back, on the right-hand side as you got on.  That morning '
             'I had my back to the window with one of my legs up on the other '
             'seat. I was cleaning my sunglasses, chatting to Trevor over the '
             'aisle about what we were going to say to the bowlers that '
             'morning.  The next thing, the bus jolted and came to a stop '
             'pretty quickly.  I turned and looked out the window over my '
             'shoulder. I could see this guy moving towards us with a gun, '
             'firing this gun.  I then looked down the front of the bus and I '
             'could see the top of a white car which had been driven onto the '
             'roundabout to block us. The next thing the bus shook again quite '
             'violently.  The Sri Lankan guys on the bus had seen bomb '
             'attacks. They were aware of bomb attacks and were probably '
             'quicker to get down. I think I was thrown to the floor with the '
             'jolt as people were shouting to get down.  Once I hit the floor, '
             'there was quite a significant amount of blood around me. I '
             "didn\\'t know where it had come from until I realised I had a "
             'thick piece of metal sticking out of my forearm.   **Bayliss:** '
             "I\\'d woken up with a bit of a headache so I was lying back on "
             'my seat with my eyes shut. I would usually be sat two back from '
             'the driver, and Tillakaratne Dilshan was in the seat in front of '
             'me, just behind the driver.  All of a sudden there was this '
             'explosion, not that close but close enough that it got your '
             'attention. Within a few seconds another hand grenade or '
             'something went off next to the bus.  I was half asleep. By the '
             'time I moved, everyone was on the floor in the middle of the '
             'bus. I just jumped down between the seats.  There was a big '
             "roundabout next to the ground and Dilshan later said there\\'d "
             'been a white vehicle reversing through it that pulled up in '
             'front of the bus.  Some guys got out and were shooting at the '
             'police in the van in front of us. There were others waiting in '
             'the middle of roundabout too.   **Farbrace:** The grenade '
             'injured us, pieces of metal in our bodies, pieces of the bus '
             'that came in.  Ajantha Mendis, who was in the seat in front of '
             "me, he\\'d fallen to the floor as well and was bleeding quite "
             'significantly from the back of his head.  On my side of the bus '
             'there was Mendis in front of me, myself, then Tharanga '
             'Paranavitana who was sat behind me. He had shrapnel in his chest '
             'and had passed out.  His white training shirt was soaked in '
             "blood. He\\'d passed out on his seat and the physio and the "
             'trainer opposite pulled him down by his legs to get him down on '
             'the floor.  Then behind them was Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan '
             'Samaraweera who were sat together.  As Sanga fell to floor Samy '
             'fell on top of him and his backside was in the air. He was hit '
             'by a bullet, it went in at the top of his thigh.   **Bayliss:** '
             'I was crouched down between the seats with my head facing the '
             'outside of the bus, I could sort of see back underneath between '
             'my legs the guys lying down in the aisle.  Farby was right '
             'behind and he had a piece of shrapnel sticking out of his arm, I '
             'could see the blood trickling down.  The calmness on the bus was '
             'one of the things that stood out to me. The only thing being '
             "said was quietly: \\'I\\'m hit\\', \\'So am I.\\' Time seems to "
             'stand still in that sort of situation.  There was nothing you '
             'could do. You just had to get low, get your head down.  The bus '
             'driver had jumped on the floor as well and then someone was '
             'shouting out to get the bus going but there were still bullets '
             "flying through the glass.  **Farbrace:** I didn\\'t think about "
             "dying. I wouldn\\'t even say I was scared. Looking at the arm I "
             "was just thinking \\'please don\\'t hit me again. I don\\'t want "
             "to be hit again\\'.  The seat where Trevor had been sat, there "
             "were three bullet holes in the window. He\\'d got down and put "
             'his rucksack with his computer in it up against the window to '
             'give himself a bit of protection.  Bullets were hitting the bus '
             'but everybody was incredibly calm. It was an eerie calm. There '
             'were bullets pinging the bus, hitting the glass, but the only '
             "voice I could hear was Dilshan\\'s. It was a very distinctive "
             'voice. I can still hear it now, I probably will for the rest of '
             'my life.  He would always sit right behind the driver. I could '
             'hear him shouting to the bus driver to reverse. The driver had '
             'got himself under the steering wheel and was steering with his '
             "arms above his head.  He\\'d started to reverse back like this "
             'while Dilshan was the one popping his head up and giving him '
             'directions to get away from the attack.  The driver was given '
             'huge credit, and his skills in getting us out of the situation '
             "were incredible, but to this day I think Dilshan\\'s bravery "
             'saved our lives. Sticking his head up and talking the driver '
             'through it, telling him where to turn, that probably saved us.  '
             'It seemed like this all lasted ages but it probably was only '
             "seconds, maybe a minute and a half, I don\\'t know. That\\'s the "
             "one area that to this day I\\'ve never been clear on - how long "
             'the whole thing took.  **Bayliss:** Some said it went on for 10 '
             'minutes but in reality, it was probably a minute or two at the '
             'longest. Time stands still in that sort of situation.  We were '
             '30 seconds or so from the stadium and so once we took off it '
             "wasn\\'t too long before we got to safety, but we could still "
             'hear the gunshots.  Luckily nobody from our tour party was '
             'killed but half a dozen policemen and another driver were. There '
             'is footage I think someone took with a phone of the umpires with '
             'their little white van being shot at right behind us.  Once we '
             'got into the ground we felt a lot safer, and it was more about '
             'trying to look after the guys who had wounds.  There was a '
             'feeling of relief to begin with, for a few of the guys that '
             'quickly started to turn into anger, especially when the '
             'Pakistani authorities came in and said everything was OK. Quite '
             "clearly it wasn\\'t OK. It was like an army hospital.   "
             '**Farbrace:** There was a lot of blood. Once we got into the '
             'changing room, with medical people coming in, officials coming '
             "in, that\\'s when the level of anger and distress among us "
             'really started to hit home.  Seeing people in our team laying on '
             'the physio beds bleeding and injured, in distress and in pain, '
             "that\\'s when we all started to realise how bad the situation "
             'was. Ajantha Mendis had somewhere in the region of 16-20 pieces '
             'of metal taken out of his head.  They tried to take us out to '
             'hospital by ambulance, but I flat out refused to go back out '
             'there, there was no way I was going anywhere by road. But Thilan '
             '[Samaraweera] and Para [Paranavitana] had to be taken because '
             'their injuries were serious.  The two guys were taken off and '
             'then, with the TVs on, watching the news in the changing rooms, '
             'they showed this picture of an ambulance with bullet holes in it '
             'and the doors blown open. We thought it was the one that had '
             'taken the players away but it was quickly proved it was one that '
             'had been in our convoy. There was a lot of emotion.  Chris '
             'Broad, the match referee, came into our room and his white match '
             'shirt was covered in blood. His face was white. He and the '
             "umpires, they\\'d been in a small minivan. We were in a good "
             'sized coach, high up and with some kind of protection. They had '
             'literally nothing.  Their van driver was shot and killed, the '
             "fourth umpire Ahsan Raza was shot in the back. They\\'d been "
             'through an unbelievable experience as well.  Steve Davis, '
             'another of the umpires, he had a bullet hole through the flare '
             "of his trouser leg. They\\'d managed to get away after a "
             'policeman got in and drove the van out for them.   **Bayliss:** '
             'I rang my wife and she was just picking the kids up from school, '
             'it was about 3pm in Australia.  Luckily I was able to speak to '
             'her because the news had been reported very quickly, and back in '
             'Australia they were saying the Sri Lankan coach had been shot - '
             "they didn\\'t use the word bus but coach. Thankfully I\\'d "
             'spoken to her by the time friends were ringing her asking if I '
             'was OK.  We were in the dressing room for about five hours. Then '
             'they got two big Chinook helicopters to land on the pitch and '
             'pick us up. That trip was a little daunting as well, we '
             "weren\\'t exactly sure what was happening.  We took off at about "
             '2:15pm, and it was a 15-minute flight to an air force base. The '
             'Sri Lankans sent an airplane with some doctors and nurses and a '
             'few of the administrators and management too.  We then took off '
             'from there at about 10 at night and flew straight back to '
             'Colombo in Sri Lanka.  **Farbrace:** That was the most nervous '
             "time, when we were in the helicopter.  There\\'d been talk of a "
             'handheld rocket launcher being fired and going over the top of '
             "the bus before, and I thought: \\'Are they going to attack "
             "again?\\'  Even when the plane took off I was really nervous "
             "until we got to a height where I thought we\\'d be safe.  Most "
             'of us spent at least a week in hospital in Colombo. It became a '
             'bit of a hub. Ajantha Mendis used to come and sit on the spare '
             "bed in my room, some of the other younger lads too, and we\\'d "
             "spend a long time chatting.  There\\'s a very close bond behind "
             'those of us involved in the incident, and that is something you '
             'will never lose. That panic and fear we all had.  There are '
             'always going to be the tough memories. And the attack definitely '
             'had an effect on me and the way I was for a period. Probably for '
             "four months I slept with the light on. I didn\\'t like people "
             'walking behind me. After a while you go back to normal, if there '
             'is a normal.  But I saw Ajantha recently and he said he '
             'remembered a time when a load of firecrackers went off outside '
             "the hospital window and I\\'d jumped under the bed because I was "
             "so nervous. It was the first time since the attack that we\\'d "
             'all laughed, he said. One small piece of humour in a really '
             'emotionally tough experience to go through.  It was horrendous '
             "and people died. It just shouldn\\'t have happened, that people "
             'died trying to help us get to a match of cricket.  I have no '
             'anger or bitterness, just a deep sadness for the people who '
             "died. They weren\\'t going to war, they were just guiding us "
             'through what has always been to me a very lovely city in Lahore. '
             'That sadness I think will stay with me forever.  \\n \\n  '

             'on the team bus. Here, 10 years on, they explain how they '
             'survived.  \\n \\n  **Farbrace:** We were quite a superstitious '
             'team. We always had the same seats in the bus. I was always '
             'three back, on the right-hand side as you got on.  That morning '
             'I had my back to the window with one of my legs up on the other '
             'seat. I was cleaning my sunglasses, chatting to Trevor over the '
             'aisle about what we were going to say to the bowlers that '
             'morning.  The next thing, the bus jolted and came to a stop '
             'pretty quickly.  I turned and looked out the window over my '
             'shoulder. I could see this guy moving towards us with a gun, '
             'firing this gun.  I then looked down the front of the bus and I '
             'could see the top of a white car which had been driven onto the '
             'roundabout to block us. The next thing the bus shook again quite '
             'violently.  The Sri Lankan guys on the bus had seen bomb '
             'attacks. They were aware of bomb attacks and were probably '
             'quicker to get down. I think I was thrown to the floor with the '
             'jolt as people were shouting to get down.  Once I hit the floor, '
             'there was quite a significant amount of blood around me. I '
             "didn\\'t know where it had come from until I realised I had a "
             'thick piece of metal sticking out of my forearm.   **Bayliss:** '
             "I\\'d woken up with a bit of a headache so I was lying back on "
             'my seat with my eyes shut. I would usually be sat two back from '
             'the driver, and Tillakaratne Dilshan was in the seat in front of '
             'me, just behind the driver.  All of a sudden there was this '
             'explosion, not that close but close enough that it got your '
             'attention. Within a few seconds another hand grenade or '
             'something went off next to the bus.  I was half asleep. By the '
             'time I moved, everyone was on the floor in the middle of the '
             'bus. I just jumped down between the seats.  There was a big '
             "roundabout next to the ground and Dilshan later said there\\'d "
             'been a white vehicle reversing through it that pulled up in '
             'front of the bus.  Some guys got out and were shooting at the '
             'police in the van in front of us. There were others waiting in '
             'the middle of roundabout too.   **Farbrace:** The grenade '
             'injured us, pieces of metal in our bodies, pieces of the bus '
             'that came in.  Ajantha Mendis, who was in the seat in front of '
             "me, he\\'d fallen to the floor as well and was bleeding quite "
             'significantly from the back of his head.  On my side of the bus '
             'there was Mendis in front of me, myself, then Tharanga '
             'Paranavitana who was sat behind me. He had shrapnel in his chest '
             'and had passed out.  His white training shirt was soaked in '
             "blood. He\\'d passed out on his seat and the physio and the "
             'trainer opposite pulled him down by his legs to get him down on '
             'the floor.  Then behind them was Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan '
             'Samaraweera who were sat together.  As Sanga fell to floor Samy '
             'fell on top of him and his backside was in the air. He was hit '
             'by a bullet, it went in at the top of his thigh.   **Bayliss:** '
             'I was crouched down between the seats with my head facing the '
             'outside of the bus, I could sort of see back underneath between '
             'my legs the guys lying down in the aisle.  Farby was right '
             'behind and he had a piece of shrapnel sticking out of his arm, I '
             'could see the blood trickling down.  The calmness on the bus was '
             'one of the things that stood out to me. The only thing being '
             "said was quietly: \\'I\\'m hit\\', \\'So am I.\\' Time seems to "
             'stand still in that sort of situation.  There was nothing you '
             'could do. You just had to get low, get your head down.  The bus '
             'driver had jumped on the floor as well and then someone was '
             'shouting out to get the bus going but there were still bullets '
             "flying through the glass.  **Farbrace:** I didn\\'t think about "
             "dying. I wouldn\\'t even say I was scared. Looking at the arm I "
             "was just thinking \\'please don\\'t hit me again. I don\\'t want "
             "to be hit again\\'.  The seat where Trevor had been sat, there "
             "were three bullet holes in the window. He\\'d got down and put "
             'his rucksack with his computer in it up against the window to '
             'give himself a bit of protection.  Bullets were hitting the bus '
             'but everybody was incredibly calm. It was an eerie calm. There '
             'were bullets pinging the bus, hitting the glass, but the only '
             "voice I could hear was Dilshan\\'s. It was a very distinctive "
             'voice. I can still hear it now, I probably will for the rest of '
             'my life.  He would always sit right behind the driver. I could '
             'hear him shouting to the bus driver to reverse. The driver had '
             'got himself under the steering wheel and was steering with his '
             "arms above his head.  He\\'d started to reverse back like this "
             'while Dilshan was the one popping his head up and giving him '
             'directions to get away from the attack.  The driver was given '
             'huge credit, and his skills in getting us out of the situation '
             "were incredible, but to this day I think Dilshan\\'s bravery "
             'saved our lives. Sticking his head up and talking the driver '
             'through it, telling him where to turn, that probably saved us.  '
             'It seemed like this all lasted ages but it probably was only '
             "seconds, maybe a minute and a half, I don\\'t know. That\\'s the "
             "one area that to this day I\\'ve never been clear on - how long "
             'the whole thing took.  **Bayliss:** Some said it went on for 10 '
             'minutes but in reality, it was probably a minute or two at the '
             'longest. Time stands still in that sort of situation.  We were '
             '30 seconds or so from the stadium and so once we took off it '
             "wasn\\'t too long before we got to safety, but we could still "
             'hear the gunshots.  Luckily nobody from our tour party was '
             'killed but half a dozen policemen and another driver were. There '
             'is footage I think someone took with a phone of the umpires with '
             'their little white van being shot at right behind us.  Once we '
             'got into the ground we felt a lot safer, and it was more about '
             'trying to look after the guys who had wounds.  There was a '
             'feeling of relief to begin with, for a few of the guys that '
             'quickly started to turn into anger, especially when the '
             'Pakistani authorities came in and said everything was OK. Quite '
             "clearly it wasn\\'t OK. It was like an army hospital.   "
             '**Farbrace:** There was a lot of blood. Once we got into the '
             'changing room, with medical people coming in, officials coming '
             "in, that\\'s when the level of anger and distress among us "
             'really started to hit home.  Seeing people in our team laying on '
             'the physio beds bleeding and injured, in distress and in pain, '
             "that\\'s when we all started to realise how bad the situation "
             'was. Ajantha Mendis had somewhere in the region of 16-20 pieces '
             'of metal taken out of his head.  They tried to take us out to '
             'hospital by ambulance, but I flat out refused to go back out '
             'there, there was no way I was going anywhere by road. But Thilan '
             '[Samaraweera] and Para [Paranavitana] had to be taken because '
             'their injuries were serious.  The two guys were taken off and '
             'then, with the TVs on, watching the news in the changing rooms, '
             'they showed this picture of an ambulance with bullet holes in it '
             'and the doors blown open. We thought it was the one that had '
             'taken the players away but it was quickly proved it was one that '
             'had been in our convoy. There was a lot of emotion.  Chris '
             'Broad, the match referee, came into our room and his white match '
             'shirt was covered in blood. His face was white. He and the '
             "umpires, they\\'d been in a small minivan. We were in a good "
             'sized coach, high up and with some kind of protection. They had '
             'literally nothing.  Their van driver was shot and killed, the '
             "fourth umpire Ahsan Raza was shot in the back. They\\'d been "
             'through an unbelievable experience as well.  Steve Davis, '
             'another of the umpires, he had a bullet hole through the flare '
             "of his trouser leg. They\\'d managed to get away after a "
             'policeman got in and drove the van out for them.   **Bayliss:** '
             'I rang my wife and she was just picking the kids up from school, '
             'it was about 3pm in Australia.  Luckily I was able to speak to '
             'her because the news had been reported very quickly, and back in '
             'Australia they were saying the Sri Lankan coach had been shot - '
             "they didn\\'t use the word bus but coach. Thankfully I\\'d "
             'spoken to her by the time friends were ringing her asking if I '
             'was OK.  We were in the dressing room for about five hours. Then '
             'they got two big Chinook helicopters to land on the pitch and '
             'pick us up. That trip was a little daunting as well, we '
             "weren\\'t exactly sure what was happening.  We took off at about "
             '2:15pm, and it was a 15-minute flight to an air force base. The '
             'Sri Lankans sent an airplane with some doctors and nurses and a '
             'few of the administrators and management too.  We then took off '
             'from there at about 10 at night and flew straight back to '
             'Colombo in Sri Lanka.  **Farbrace:** That was the most nervous '
             "time, when we were in the helicopter.  There\\'d been talk of a "
             'handheld rocket launcher being fired and going over the top of '
             "the bus before, and I thought: \\'Are they going to attack "
             "again?\\'  Even when the plane took off I was really nervous "
             "until we got to a height where I thought we\\'d be safe.  Most "
             'of us spent at least a week in hospital in Colombo. It became a '
             'bit of a hub. Ajantha Mendis used to come and sit on the spare '
             "bed in my room, some of the other younger lads too, and we\\'d "
             "spend a long time chatting.  There\\'s a very close bond behind "
             'those of us involved in the incident, and that is something you '
             'will never lose. That panic and fear we all had.  There are '
             'always going to be the tough memories. And the attack definitely '
             'had an effect on me and the way I was for a period. Probably for '
             "four months I slept with the light on. I didn\\'t like people "
             'walking behind me. After a while you go back to normal, if there '
             'is a normal.  But I saw Ajantha recently and he said he '
             'remembered a time when a load of firecrackers went off outside '
             "the hospital window and I\\'d jumped under the bed because I was "
             "so nervous. It was the first time since the attack that we\\'d "
             'all laughed, he said. One small piece of humour in a really '
             'emotionally tough experience to go through.  It was horrendous '
             "and people died. It just shouldn\\'t have happened, that people "
             'died trying to help us get to a match of cricket.  I have no '
             'anger or bitterness, just a deep sadness for the people who '
             "died. They weren\\'t going to war, they were just guiding us "
             'through what has always been to me a very lovely city in Lahore. '
             'That sadness I think will stay with me forever.  \\n \\n  '

                 b'history - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': "For all its flaws and formatting faults, the men\\'s Cricket "
             'World Cup has served up many remarkable matches over its 11 '
             'previous editions.  Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu '
             'Sharma, who present Stumped on BBC World Service, have been '
             'raking through their collective memory banks to come up with a '
             'list of matches which include seismic upsets, tight finishes and '
             'games whose significance resonated far beyond cricket.  Here are '
             'the 10 greatest matches in Cricket World Cup history, as '
             'nominated by Stumped.  Take a look, then have your say in the '
             'comments section below. The full podcast is here.  ### 10\\. New '
             "Zealand v South Africa, 2015  \\n Elliott\\'s six off the "
             'penultimate ball helped New Zealand reach the World Cup final '
             'for the first time in 2015  This was a rollercoaster of a '
             'semi-final in which the fortunes of both teams fluctuated back '
             'and forth, with the outcome in the balance right into the final '
             'over.  Chasing 298 in 43 overs after rain, New Zealand were '
             'struggling at 149-4 in the 22nd over, but as a raucous Eden Park '
             'crowd cheered every run, Grant Elliott and Corey Anderson hauled '
             'them back into contention.  With five needed from two balls, '
             'Elliott launched Dale Steyn into the Auckland night sky to send '
             'New Zealand into their first World Cup final.  "It\\\'s probably '
             "the most pressure I\\'ve had in my career in terms of a single "
             'moment because it was literally hero or zero," recalled '
             'Elliott.  "I didn\\\'t want to leave it to the last ball, so '
             'wherever the ball was I was going to have a go at it. '
             'Fortunately for me it was in a good position and the rest was a '
             'lot of relief. To achieve what seemed unachievable at the start '
             'of the tournament was a pretty awesome feeling."  ### 9\\. '
             "Pakistan v England, 1992  \\n Pakistan\\'s greatest moment in "
             'World Cup history came in 1992 with victory in Australia  A '
             'first World Cup title for Pakistan as Wasim Akram - inspired by '
             'Imran Khan\\\'s instruction to fight like "cornered tigers" - '
             'ripped the heart out of England.  Half-centuries for Imran and '
             'Javed Miandad helped Pakistan post 249-6 in front of a full '
             'house at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  And although England '
             'recovered from a rocky start, Wasim produced inswinging yorkers '
             'in successive balls to remove Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis, and '
             'effectively ensure a third World Cup final defeat for England.  '
             '"When we got back to Lahore, a bus journey that would normally '
             'take 20 minutes took seven hours," said Wasim.  "The streets '
             "were packed and we just crawled along. It\\'s something you "
             "dream of. I\\'ve never seen anything like that before and I "
             'don\\\'t think I ever will again."  ### 8\\. India v Australia, '
             '1987  \\n Allan Border is one of four Australian captains to '
             'have won the World Cup  Chennai witnessed one of the World '
             "Cup\\'s closest ever finishes as Australia pipped holders India "
             'by one run in the group stages.  India needed two runs off two '
             'balls to reach their target of 271 when a young Steve Waugh '
             'bowled Maninder Singh to take the spoils.  The outcome could '
             "have been very different had Australia\\'s Dean Jones not "
             'persisted in his determination to right a perceived wrong during '
             'Australia\\\'s innings.  "I was facing Maninder Singh, the '
             'left-arm orthodox, and I hit one down the ground," said Jones. '
             '"Ravi Shastri was on the boundary and it looked plain and clear '
             'to me that it went over his arm and carried beyond the rope, but '
             'Ravi said it was four, so we all complained.  "I looked at '
             '[umpire] Dickie Bird and he said he had to take the word of the '
             'fielder.  "I got out not long afterwards and ran into the match '
             "referee who was Hanif Mohammed. I complained and he said we\\'ll "
             'talk about it at the end of the innings.  "Dickie Bird walked '
             'into their dressing-room and gave Ravi another chance. He said '
             'let him have it for six so they changed the score from 268 to '
             '270.  "I\\\'m not sure if that had ever happened before."  ### '
             '7\\. India v Zimbabwe, 1983  \\n Former India captain Kapil Dev '
             'and the rest of the team became national heroes overnight after '
             "winning the 1983 World Cup  Kapil\\'s match, as it\\'s become "
             'known, was never televised but is ingrained in the memory of all '
             'those who attended among the rhododendrons of Tunbridge Wells.  '
             'A major upset looked on the cards when World Cup newcomers '
             "Zimbabwe reduced India to 17-5.  But India\\'s captain had a "
             'different storyline in mind. His astonishing 175 not out from '
             'just 138 balls lifted India to what proved a match-winning score '
             'of 266-8.  "We took lunch after 40 overs and they were still '
             'only about 100-7. We were well in control, but then Kapil just '
             'changed gear," said Zimbabwe wicketkeeper Dave Houghton, who had '
             'a close-up view of the brutal assault.  "He didn\\\'t miscue one '
             'ball. Everything he went for he hit like a tracer bullet along '
             "the ground or like a missile out of the ground. It wasn\\'t like "
             "we dropped him or he had a close shave, he didn\\'t give a "
             'chance."  ### 6\\. India v Sri Lanka, 2011  \\n India captain MS '
             'Dhoni hits the winning shot against Sri Lanka at the 2011 World '
             'Cup  India beat Sri Lanka in a thrilling final to deliver World '
             'Cup glory to their cricket-mad population on home soil.  With '
             "his team seemingly stalling in pursuit of Sri Lanka\\'s 274-6, "
             'captain MS Dhoni shifted himself up the order and paced his '
             "team\\'s run-chase to perfection.  Gautam Gambhir\\'s 97 became "
             'little more than a footnote as Dhoni sealed the victory with a '
             'six that sailed high into the stands, providing the catalyst for '
             'euphoric celebrations in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.  "It '
             'was surreal, the culmination of a great three-year journey with '
             'the Indian team," said coach Gary Kirsten.  "They were a very '
             'talented bunch of cricketers, and all we really needed to do was '

             'World Cup has served up many remarkable matches over its 11 '
             'previous editions.  Alison Mitchell, Jim Maxwell and Charu '
             'Sharma, who present Stumped on BBC World Service, have been '
             'raking through their collective memory banks to come up with a '
             'list of matches which include seismic upsets, tight finishes and '
             'games whose significance resonated far beyond cricket.  Here are '
             'the 10 greatest matches in Cricket World Cup history, as '
             'nominated by Stumped.  Take a look, then have your say in the '

             "Zealand v South Africa, 2015  \\n Elliott\\'s six off the "
             'penultimate ball helped New Zealand reach the World Cup final '
             'for the first time in 2015  This was a rollercoaster of a '
             'semi-final in which the fortunes of both teams fluctuated back '
             'and forth, with the outcome in the balance right into the final '
             'over.  Chasing 298 in 43 overs after rain, New Zealand were '
             'struggling at 149-4 in the 22nd over, but as a raucous Eden Park '
             'crowd cheered every run, Grant Elliott and Corey Anderson hauled '
             'them back into contention.  With five needed from two balls, '
             'Elliott launched Dale Steyn into the Auckland night sky to send '
             'New Zealand into their first World Cup final.  "It\\\'s probably '
             "the most pressure I\\'ve had in my career in terms of a single "
             'moment because it was literally hero or zero," recalled '
             'Elliott.  "I didn\\\'t want to leave it to the last ball, so '
             'wherever the ball was I was going to have a go at it. '
             'Fortunately for me it was in a good position and the rest was a '
             'lot of relief. To achieve what seemed unachievable at the start '
             'of the tournament was a pretty awesome feeling."  ### 9\\. '
             "Pakistan v England, 1992  \\n Pakistan\\'s greatest moment in "
             'World Cup history came in 1992 with victory in Australia  A '
             'first World Cup title for Pakistan as Wasim Akram - inspired by '
             'Imran Khan\\\'s instruction to fight like "cornered tigers" - '
             'ripped the heart out of England.  Half-centuries for Imran and '
             'Javed Miandad helped Pakistan post 249-6 in front of a full '
             'house at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.  And although England '
             'recovered from a rocky start, Wasim produced inswinging yorkers '
             'in successive balls to remove Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis, and '
             'effectively ensure a third World Cup final defeat for England.  '
             '"When we got back to Lahore, a bus journey that would normally '
             'take 20 minutes took seven hours," said Wasim.  "The streets '
             "were packed and we just crawled along. It\\'s something you "
             "dream of. I\\'ve never seen anything like that before and I "
             'don\\\'t think I ever will again."  ### 8\\. India v Australia, '
             '1987  \\n Allan Border is one of four Australian captains to '
             'have won the World Cup  Chennai witnessed one of the World '
             "Cup\\'s closest ever finishes as Australia pipped holders India "
             'by one run in the group stages.  India needed two runs off two '
             'balls to reach their target of 271 when a young Steve Waugh '
             'bowled Maninder Singh to take the spoils.  The outcome could '
             "have been very different had Australia\\'s Dean Jones not "
             'persisted in his determination to right a perceived wrong during '
             'Australia\\\'s innings.  "I was facing Maninder Singh, the '
             'left-arm orthodox, and I hit one down the ground," said Jones. '
             '"Ravi Shastri was on the boundary and it looked plain and clear '
             'to me that it went over his arm and carried beyond the rope, but '
             'Ravi said it was four, so we all complained.  "I looked at '
             '[umpire] Dickie Bird and he said he had to take the word of the '
             'fielder.  "I got out not long afterwards and ran into the match '
             "referee who was Hanif Mohammed. I complained and he said we\\'ll "
             'talk about it at the end of the innings.  "Dickie Bird walked '
             'into their dressing-room and gave Ravi another chance. He said '
             'let him have it for six so they changed the score from 268 to '
             '270.  "I\\\'m not sure if that had ever happened before."  ### '

             'and the rest of the team became national heroes overnight after '
             "winning the 1983 World Cup  Kapil\\'s match, as it\\'s become "
             'known, was never televised but is ingrained in the memory of all '
             'those who attended among the rhododendrons of Tunbridge Wells.  '
             'A major upset looked on the cards when World Cup newcomers '
             "Zimbabwe reduced India to 17-5.  But India\\'s captain had a "
             'different storyline in mind. His astonishing 175 not out from '
             'just 138 balls lifted India to what proved a match-winning score '
             'of 266-8.  "We took lunch after 40 overs and they were still '
             'only about 100-7. We were well in control, but then Kapil just '
             'changed gear," said Zimbabwe wicketkeeper Dave Houghton, who had '
             'a close-up view of the brutal assault.  "He didn\\\'t miscue one '
             'ball. Everything he went for he hit like a tracer bullet along '
             "the ground or like a missile out of the ground. It wasn\\'t like "
             "we dropped him or he had a close shave, he didn\\'t give a "
             'chance."  ### 6\\. India v Sri Lanka, 2011  \\n India captain MS '

             'Cup glory to their cricket-mad population on home soil.  With '

             'captain MS Dhoni shifted himself up the order and paced his '
             "team\\'s run-chase to perfection.  Gautam Gambhir\\'s 97 became "
             'little more than a footnote as Dhoni sealed the victory with a '
             'six that sailed high into the stands, providing the catalyst for '
             'euphoric celebrations in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.  "It '
             'was surreal, the culmination of a great three-year journey with '
             'the Indian team," said coach Gary Kirsten.  "They were a very '
             'talented bunch of cricketers, and all we really needed to do was '

             'run-out in cricketing history.  "I don\\\'t know if Lance called '
             'but he just started running," recalled Fleming. "The ball was '
             'close enough to my right hand so Donald stayed in his crease. I '
             'got the ball and proceeded to underarm the ball to poor Adam '
             'Gilchrist at about 1 centimetre per hour.  "Eventually Gilly got '
             'it and hit the stumps. After that it was pure euphoria - '
             'that\\\'s the reason we all play sport."  ### 1\\. 1975 '
             'Australia v West Indies  \\n Clive Lloyd led the West Indies to '
             'the first of their two World Cup wins in 1975  The first ever '
             'World Cup final was a thrilling contest involving some of the '
             'leading Test cricketers of the age adapting their skills to the '
             "brave new world of one-day cricket.  Clive Lloyd\\'s blistering "
             "hundred and Viv Richards\\' spectacular fielding are the "
             'enduring images but the Australians more than played their part '
             'in an historic occasion.  An unlikely last-wicket stand between '
             'Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee kept Aussie hopes alive right '
             'into the penultimate over before Deryck Murray ran out Thomson '
             'to unleash thousands of delighted West Indian supporters onto '
             'the hallowed turf of Lord\\\'s.  "It was a very good day for '
             'cricket," said Australia captain Ian Chappell. "The two best '
             'teams got into the final and it was such a terrific game. I '
             'certainly thought after that the World Cup is here to stay."  '
             '"We made a lot of people happy," said Lloyd. "It was an exciting '
             'day, an exciting game and I think we thoroughly enjoyed it. In '
             'those days the ordinary fan could get a ticket and a lot of West '
             'Indians were there. I thank that victory was the starting point '
             'of our great run."  _Download the Stumped podcast for a truly '

             'take on South Africa at The Oval.  After a dismal showing four '
             'years ago, England enter this tournament as favourites and the '
             'number one side in the world.  But will they lift the World Cup '
             'for the first time? Test Match Special pundits and commentators, '
             'former players and journalists give their predictions on who '
             'will make the semi-finals and who will get their hands on the '
             "trophy on 14 July.  Does anyone think England won\\'t do it?  "
             '### Former England captain Michael Vaughan  England are the '
             "number one team in the world and formidable at home. I can\\'t "
             "see how they won\\'t make the semis.  Australia have just got "
             'something going, Steve Smith and David Warner are back and you '
             'can argue that they have the best bowling attack.  India have '
             'the know-how. Virat Kohli is the best batsman in the world and '
             'Jasprit Bumrah is the best bowler in the world.  Pakistan are '
             'Pakistan - they will find a way of making the top four. It '
             'concerns me that **England** play in one way. They will get '
             "tested, but I\\'m sticking with them as my winners.  ### Former "
             'England captain Alec Stewart  The semi-finalists will be '
             'England, India, Australia and, if Dale Steyn stays fit, South '
             'Africa.  England cover all bases and are very well led, India '
             'have top players and stand up in world tournaments, while '
             'Australia are just starting to peak. Steyn will be key to South '
             "Africa - he\\'s only one man, but has the experience and can do "
             "brilliant things with the ball.  I\\'m picking **England** as "
             'the winners - it will be a fitting finale for the work done by '
             'captain Eoin Morgan and coach Trevor Bayliss, and started by '
             'former director of cricket Andrew Strauss.  ### Ebony '
             "Rainford-Brent, 2009 Women\\'s World Cup winner with England  "
             'Pakistan are my wildcard - whether they find have form or not, '
             'they find something in big tournaments.  West Indies could '
             'spring a surprise too. With the likes of Chris Gayle and Shimron '
             'Hetmyer, their batting will be a lot of fun.  Those two teams '
             'will join England and India in the semis, and **England** will '
             'be the eventual winners. Jofra Archer has covered the only area '
             'where they were possibly lacking and Eoin Morgan will hold it '
             'all together.  \\n England are unbeaten in their past 12 ODI '
             'bilateral series, winning 11 and drawing one  ### Phil Tufnell, '
             'part of England squad that reached 1992 final  The semis will be '
             'made up of Australia, India, Pakistan and England. Australia '
             'have a very good bowling side and are starting to get their mojo '
             'back.  India have a battalion of batsmen and Pakistan know how '
             'to get over the line in tournament cricket.  Having said all of '
             'that, **England** are favourites and will be the winners.  ### '
             "Isa Guha, 2009 Women\\'s World Cup winner with England  Until "
             "recently, I had Pakistan reaching the semis, but I\\'ve switched "
             'them for West Indies. With the likes of Chris Gayle and Andre '
             'Russell, the Windies can blitz teams with the bat and their '
             'experienced bowlers have come back into the squad.  They will '
             'join England, India and Australia in the last four, with '
             '**England** going on to win it.  ### Waqar Younis, 1992 World '
             'Cup winner with Pakistan  The format means anyone who hits form '

             'getting their confidence back and India are the most likely of '
             'the teams from the subcontinent.  After that, my heart wants to '
             'say Pakistan, but New Zealand are most likely to complete the '
             "last four.  I can\\'t pick a winner, but it seems most probable "
             'that **England** will be up there.  ### Vic Marks, played for '
             'England in 1983 World Cup  England and India are both very good '
             'teams. They will reach the last four. They will be joined by '
             'Australia, who always do well and South Africa, because no-one '
             'is expecting them to do anything.  Bearing in mind my record as '
             "a tipster, I\\'ll say **Australia** will win it, because I want "
             'that to be wrong.  ### Tymal Mills, England Twenty20 bowler  '
             'England, Australia and India are not shocking picks as '
             'semi-finalists.  They will be joined by New Zealand. I like '
             'their bowling attack - Trent Boult and Tim Southee will do well '
             'in English conditions and Lockie Ferguson has real pace. In '
             'their batting, Martin Guptill and Colin Munro can score big '
             'hundreds, while Kane Williamson is one of the best in the '
             'world.   **England** will win it because they are the best team, '
             'although any sort of injury to Adil Rashid would be a concern.  '
             '### Charles Dagnall, TMS commentator  England and India are '
             'straightforward picks, but the other two are more difficult. '
             'Australia are coming back and finding their identity after a '
             'tough 12 months. No-one is talking about New Zealand, but '
             "they\\'re a wonderful side with a lot of bases covered.   "
             '**England** will win it. It is their time.  \\n Steve Smith '
             'scored a century against England in their World Cup warm-up '
             'match on Saturday, his first hundred for Australia since '
             'returning from a 12-month ban for ball-tampering  ### Jonathan '
             'Agnew, BBC cricket correspondent  India are so experienced. In '
             'Virat Kohli, they have the best batsman in the world and their '
             'pace attack stands out.  If Australia can use the hostility '
             'towards Steve Smith and David Warner to create a siege '
             'mentality, they will be strong, and West Indies have some '
             'serious hitters who can take advantage of the small boundaries '
             'that we are expecting.  Those three will be in the semis, along '
             'with **England,** who are favourites to win it. If they can use '
             'being hosts as a positive instead of a pressure, it will be a '
             "surprise if they don\\'t lift the trophy.  ### Daniel Norcross, "
             'TMS commentator  The format means the best sides will rise to '
             "the top, and the two best sides are England and India.  I\\'ve "
             'discarded Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, so '
             "I\\'m picking two from the other four. My head says Australia "
             "and South Africa, but I\\'m going with my heart and plumping for "
             "New Zealand and West Indies.  I\\'d love to say that England "
             'will win it, but I think **India** will come out on top.  ### '
             'Simon Mann, TMS commentator  England, Australia and India will '
             'make the semis. After that I have no idea. The format means the '
             'best should rise to the top and I think only Sri Lanka and '
             'Afghanistan have no chance of making the top four, while the '
             'romantic in me wants West Indies or Bangladesh to make it.  '
             'Asian teams have done well in one-day cricket of late - the last '
             'two Champions Trophies have been won by Pakistan and India. '
             '**India** will win the World Cup because they are a very good '
             'side.  \\n India captain Virat Kohli is the number one batsman '
             'in the ODI rankings. He averages 59.57 and has scored 41 '
             'hundreds  ### Alison Mitchell, TMS commentator  West Indies will '
             "reach the semis. I\\'m excited by how they pushed England in the "
             "Caribbean over the winter. If it\\'s about who can make the most "
             'runs, they are well stocked.  With Steve Smith and David Warner '
             'out, guys who may have been in the shadow have had the chance to '
             'flourish for Australia. Now Smith and Warner have returned, it '
             'gives Australia a boost to elevate them to the semis.  You just '
             "can\\'t see how England and India will miss out on the top four. "
             '**England** have had so much success in bilateral series. Can '
             'they replicate that? I think they can and they will win the '
             'World Cup.  ### Geoff Lemon, writer and TMS commentator  We keep '
             'hearing that Australia are back in town, but their lack of '
             'power- hitting outside Glenn Maxwell leaves a lot resting on '
             "their bowlers. They\\'ll deliver some wins but should miss out "
             "to South Africa, a similar side but with Kagiso Rabada\\'s "
             'menace and more hitters down the order.  New Zealand will make '
             'the semis based on all-round cohesion. India have the best '
             'bowlers and half of the best batsmen, but must survive having '
             'their weak links tested.  **England** will finish on top though: '
             "a new age has begun, and even the calamities of old won\\'t be "
             'enough to make this team wobble.  ### George Dobell, '
             'ESPNcricinfo  England, Australia, India and New Zealand are the '
             'best balanced sides. West Indies and South Africa are dangerous, '
             'but Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh could really '
             "struggle.  Wouldn\\'t it be painful if this summer of cricket "
             'saw Australia leave with the World Cup and the Ashes? But '
             "**England** have a great chance - they won\\'t have a better one "
             'for a long time.  ### Prakash Wakankar, TMS commentator  I '
             "can\\'t think of a time when England have been better equipped. "
             'They will be joined in the semis by Australia, who are a team '
             'with nothing to lose.  Irrespective of the result, Pakistan have '
             'had preparation by playing a series in England, while India - '
             'ranked second in the world - have always performed well in '
             'tournaments in the UK.  It will be an England-India final, which '
             '**England** will win if they hold their nerve. I have some '
             'doubts, though, so it could be an encore of 1983 for India.  ### '
             'Natalie Germanos, TMS commentator  India, England, Pakistan and '
             "South Africa will make up the top four.  India\\'s batting is "
             'explosive and they have bowlers that put the opposition under '

             'years ago, England enter this tournament as favourites and the '
             'number one side in the world.  But will they lift the World Cup '

             'will make the semi-finals and who will get their hands on the '
             "trophy on 14 July.  Does anyone think England won\\'t do it?  "
             '### Former England captain Michael Vaughan  England are the '
             "number one team in the world and formidable at home. I can\\'t "
             "see how they won\\'t make the semis.  Australia have just got "
             'something going, Steve Smith and David Warner are back and you '
             'can argue that they have the best bowling attack.  India have '
             'the know-how. Virat Kohli is the best batsman in the world and '
             'Jasprit Bumrah is the best bowler in the world.  Pakistan are '
             'Pakistan - they will find a way of making the top four. It '
             'concerns me that **England** play in one way. They will get '
             "tested, but I\\'m sticking with them as my winners.  ### Former "
             'England captain Alec Stewart  The semi-finalists will be '
             'England, India, Australia and, if Dale Steyn stays fit, South '
             'Africa.  England cover all bases and are very well led, India '
             'have top players and stand up in world tournaments, while '
             'Australia are just starting to peak. Steyn will be key to South '
             "Africa - he\\'s only one man, but has the experience and can do "
             "brilliant things with the ball.  I\\'m picking **England** as "
             'the winners - it will be a fitting finale for the work done by '
             'captain Eoin Morgan and coach Trevor Bayliss, and started by '

             "Rainford-Brent, 2009 Women\\'s World Cup winner with England  "
             'Pakistan are my wildcard - whether they find have form or not, '
             'they find something in big tournaments.  West Indies could '
             'spring a surprise too. With the likes of Chris Gayle and Shimron '
             'Hetmyer, their batting will be a lot of fun.  Those two teams '
             'will join England and India in the semis, and **England** will '
             'be the eventual winners. Jofra Archer has covered the only area '
             'where they were possibly lacking and Eoin Morgan will hold it '
             'all together.  \\n England are unbeaten in their past 12 ODI '
             'bilateral series, winning 11 and drawing one  ### Phil Tufnell, '
             'part of England squad that reached 1992 final  The semis will be '
             'made up of Australia, India, Pakistan and England. Australia '
             'have a very good bowling side and are starting to get their mojo '
             'back.  India have a battalion of batsmen and Pakistan know how '
             'to get over the line in tournament cricket.  Having said all of '
             'that, **England** are favourites and will be the winners.  ### '

             "recently, I had Pakistan reaching the semis, but I\\'ve switched "
             'them for West Indies. With the likes of Chris Gayle and Andre '
             'Russell, the Windies can blitz teams with the bat and their '
             'experienced bowlers have come back into the squad.  They will '
             'join England, India and Australia in the last four, with '
             '**England** going on to win it.  ### Waqar Younis, 1992 World '

                 b' to the world - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n Islamabad United won the PSL in 2018  Cricket is the talk of '
             "the town in Karachi.  More than 10 years after Pakistan\\'s most "
             "populous city last hosted a Test match, some of the world\\'s "
             'biggest names are back for the business end of a 20-over '
             'franchise tournament, the Pakistan Super League (PSL).  And with '
             "it comes incredible attention; the eyes of a nation.  That\\'s "
             'because the league is not only a cricket tournament on home '
             'soil, but a message to the world about the improved security '
             'situation in the country which became a no-go zone for '
             'international players after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka '
             'cricket team in 2009.  With foreign players and teams now '
             'regularly travelling to the country, the perception of '
             "Pakistan\\'s security is changing.  ### Foreign players in "
             "Pakistan  \\n New Zealand\\'s Luke Ronchi trains under armed "
             'guard in Karachi, where the final eight matches of the '
             'competition are being held. The earlier stages of the tournament '
             'were held in the UAE  Even though Pakistan has hosted four PSL '
             "games in the past, four international cricket tours by men\\'s "
             'teams (Zimbabwe in 2015, World XI and Sri Lanka in 2017 and West '
             "Indies in 2018) and two women\\'s tours (Bangladesh in 2015 and "
             'West Indies in 2019), the ongoing PSL is the largest cricket '
             'activity in Pakistan for 10 years.  Over the course of the last '
             'week, Karachi has welcomed 39 foreign players from the six '
             'competing teams.  Of the 39 foreign stars, 14 have come from the '
             'UK: Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Harry Gurney, James Vince, Laurie '
             'Evans, Liam Dawson, Liam Livingstone, Max Waller, Philip Salt, '
             'Ravi Bopara, Rikki Wessels, Samit Patel, Tymal Mills and Wayne '
             'Madsen.  Shane Watson (Australia), Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard '
             '(both West Indies) and Colin Munro (New Zealand) are some of the '
             'other big names who are in Pakistan for the tournament.  '
             "\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  Watson\\'s presence in the country "
             'strengthens the notion players are putting security fears behind '
             'them - he had refused to travel to Pakistan in the previous two '
             'tournaments.  Hales is another individual who could change '
             'perceptions. He was one of the two players who pulled out of '
             "England\\'s tour of Bangladesh in 2016 \\- albeit he travelled "
             'there this year for the Bangladesh Premier League.  Lancashire '
             'captain Liam Livingstone, who scored 82 off 43 balls on his PSL '
             'debut for the Karachi Kings and shared a tournament-record '
             "157-run partnership with Pakistan\\'s Babar Azam in the process, "
             'has been impressed by security arrangements.  "Security has been '
             'unbelievable," said Livingstone. "There is a massive change in '
             'my perception about Pakistan.  "International teams can '
             'definitely come back and tour Pakistan. The crowds here deserve '
             'international cricket.  "We have been looked after really well. '
             'It is nice to bring cricket back to Pakistan. You can obviously '
             'see how much people love cricket here. It has been great to put '
             'a smile back to their faces.  "With the same security (armoured '
             'convoys to the ground), it will be an easy decision for us to '
             'come back to Pakistan if there is an opportunity."  ### How big '
             'is the PSL in Pakistan?  \\n The tournament has been a success '
             'with the crowds in Pakistan who are desperate to see '
             "international cricket return to the country  Put simply, it\\'s "
             "big - both financially and from the fans\\' point of view.  The "
             'latest three-year deal for television and digital rights was '
             'sold for $36m (£27.1m) - an increase of 358% on the previous '
             'deal - while the three-year title sponsorship deal is now worth '
             '$14.3m (£10.8m).  The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also receives '
             '$16.5m (£12.4m) per year in franchise fees from the six teams: '
             'Islamabad United, Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalandars, Multan '
             'Sultans, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators.  When the '
             'franchise agreement for Multan Sultans with a Dubai-based '
             'business group - who had purchased it for $5.2m in 2017 - was '
             'terminated last year due to its inability to meet financial '
             'demands, there was a fear the PCB would not be able to meet the '
             'price again.  Instead, the new buyer purchased it at $6.35m, '
             'which is $3.75m more than the most expensive franchise - Karachi '
             "Kings ($2.6m) - cost at the time of the league\\'s inception in "
             '2015.  The amounts may seem small compared to other tournaments '
             "such as the Indian Premier League and Australia\\'s Big Bash "
             'League, but the PCB believes such deals will become more '
             'lucrative once the PSL is fully hosted in Pakistan.  Only eight '
             'out of 34 games have been held in Pakistan this year with the '
             'rest being played in the UAE, where the Pakistan national team '
             "plays the majority of its \\'home\\' matches.  The PCB is "
             'expecting to have at least half of the tournament in Pakistan '
             'from next year.  Three of the eight games this year were '
             'originally scheduled in Lahore but they were shifted to Karachi '
             "as Lahore\\'s airspace was closed in wake of the recent "
             'India-Pakistan border skirmishes.  In terms of support, nearly '
             '200,000 people will have been at the National Stadium across the '
             'seven days the PSL has been in town while, perhaps more '
             "impressively, 90% of the television audience in the nation\\'s "
             'capital, Islamabad, watched the final between their team and and '
             'Peshawar last year.  ### Has the PSL unearthed any new talent?  '
             '\\n The final will be held at the National Stadium in Karachi  '
             'Pakistan is renowned for producing exciting cricketers and has '
             'continued to do so despite playing such little cricket at home '
             'for a decade.  In 2017, the national team won the Champions '
             "Trophy in England, while the nation\\'s T20 team are ranked "
             'number one in the world.  If anything, the PSL has accelerated '
             'the production line, with both Hasan Ali - the player of the '
             "tournament in Pakistan\\'s Champions Trophy success - and Fakhar "
             'Zaman, the man of the match in the final against India at The '
             'Oval, fast-tracked to the national side after impressive '
             'showings in the PSL.  This year, in particular, the tournament '
             'has been productive for fast bowlers.  A case in point is '
             'Mohammad Hasnain, an 18-year-old speedster who has been clocked '
             'at 94mph.  His nine wickets in six matches for Quetta '
             'Gladiators, at an average of 20.11, have resulted in a call-up '
             'to the national squad for the ODI series against Australia which '
             'starts in the UAE on 22 March.  Haris Rauf is another fast '
             'bowler who has been highly impressive. The 25-year- old has come '
             'through the development programme of Lahore Qalandars and taken '
             '11 wickets at 7.41 in the tournament.  \\n Prime minister Imran '
             'Khan - the former World Cup-winning all-rounder - wants to hold '
             'all of the 2020 PSL in Pakistan  Among spin bowling talent, '
             '19-year-old left-arm tweaker Umer Khan, who made his T20 debut '
             'in the PSL, has been a match-winner for Karachi Kings and '
             'appears to have the knack of getting big wickets.  Of his 15 '
             'wickets in the tournament, all are of batsmen in the top-five '
             'positions.  Shane Watson (twice), AB de Villiers, James Vince, '
             'Luke Ronchi and Shoaib Malik are some of the marquee players he '
             'has dismissed in his short career.  Livingstone, who is a '
             "team-mate of Umer, has been impressed with Pakistan\\'s bowling "
             'talent.  "I am surprised how good the bowling has been in the '
             "PSL. I haven\\'t played in other leagues so I can\\'t compare it "
             'with them but compared to England the bowling has been '
             'definitely better in this competition," said Livingstone.  The '
             'tournament concludes on Sunday when Quetta Gladiators, led by '
             'Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, meet Peshawar Zalmi, for whom '
             'England all-rounder Chris Jordan took three wickets in '
             "Friday\\'s final eliminator against Islamabad United.  And for "
             'those three or four hours while the game is ongoing, the nation '
             'will stop and watch the cricket.  Could it be that T20 - so long '
             'seen as a threat to Test cricket - offers the longer format a '
             'route back into Pakistan? The world of cricket certainly hopes '
             'so.  \\n',

             "populous city last hosted a Test match, some of the world\\'s "
             'biggest names are back for the business end of a 20-over '
             'franchise tournament, the Pakistan Super League (PSL).  And with '
             "it comes incredible attention; the eyes of a nation.  That\\'s "
             'because the league is not only a cricket tournament on home '
             'soil, but a message to the world about the improved security '
             'situation in the country which became a no-go zone for '
             'international players after a terrorist attack on the Sri Lanka '
             'cricket team in 2009.  With foreign players and teams now '
             'regularly travelling to the country, the perception of '
             "Pakistan\\'s security is changing.  ### Foreign players in "
             "Pakistan  \\n New Zealand\\'s Luke Ronchi trains under armed "
             'guard in Karachi, where the final eight matches of the '
             'competition are being held. The earlier stages of the tournament '
             'were held in the UAE  Even though Pakistan has hosted four PSL '
             "games in the past, four international cricket tours by men\\'s "
             'teams (Zimbabwe in 2015, World XI and Sri Lanka in 2017 and West '
             "Indies in 2018) and two women\\'s tours (Bangladesh in 2015 and "
             'West Indies in 2019), the ongoing PSL is the largest cricket '
             'activity in Pakistan for 10 years.  Over the course of the last '
             'week, Karachi has welcomed 39 foreign players from the six '
             'competing teams.  Of the 39 foreign stars, 14 have come from the '
             'UK: Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Harry Gurney, James Vince, Laurie '
             'Evans, Liam Dawson, Liam Livingstone, Max Waller, Philip Salt, '
             'Ravi Bopara, Rikki Wessels, Samit Patel, Tymal Mills and Wayne '
             'Madsen.  Shane Watson (Australia), Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard '
             '(both West Indies) and Colin Munro (New Zealand) are some of the '
             'other big names who are in Pakistan for the tournament.  '
             "\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n  Watson\\'s presence in the country "
             'strengthens the notion players are putting security fears behind '
             'them - he had refused to travel to Pakistan in the previous two '
             'tournaments.  Hales is another individual who could change '
             'perceptions. He was one of the two players who pulled out of '
             "England\\'s tour of Bangladesh in 2016 \\- albeit he travelled "
             'there this year for the Bangladesh Premier League.  Lancashire '
             'captain Liam Livingstone, who scored 82 off 43 balls on his PSL '
             'debut for the Karachi Kings and shared a tournament-record '
             "157-run partnership with Pakistan\\'s Babar Azam in the process, "
             'has been impressed by security arrangements.  "Security has been '
             'unbelievable," said Livingstone. "There is a massive change in '
             'my perception about Pakistan.  "International teams can '
             'definitely come back and tour Pakistan. The crowds here deserve '
             'international cricket.  "We have been looked after really well. '
             'It is nice to bring cricket back to Pakistan. You can obviously '
             'see how much people love cricket here. It has been great to put '
             'a smile back to their faces.  "With the same security (armoured '
             'convoys to the ground), it will be an easy decision for us to '
             'come back to Pakistan if there is an opportunity."  ### How big '
             'is the PSL in Pakistan?  \\n The tournament has been a success '
             'with the crowds in Pakistan who are desperate to see '
             "international cricket return to the country  Put simply, it\\'s "
             "big - both financially and from the fans\\' point of view.  The "
             'latest three-year deal for television and digital rights was '
             'sold for $36m (£27.1m) - an increase of 358% on the previous '
             'deal - while the three-year title sponsorship deal is now worth '
             '$14.3m (£10.8m).  The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also receives '
             '$16.5m (£12.4m) per year in franchise fees from the six teams: '
             'Islamabad United, Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalandars, Multan '
             'Sultans, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators.  When the '
             'franchise agreement for Multan Sultans with a Dubai-based '
             'business group - who had purchased it for $5.2m in 2017 - was '
             'terminated last year due to its inability to meet financial '
             'demands, there was a fear the PCB would not be able to meet the '
             'price again.  Instead, the new buyer purchased it at $6.35m, '
             'which is $3.75m more than the most expensive franchise - Karachi '
             "Kings ($2.6m) - cost at the time of the league\\'s inception in "
             '2015.  The amounts may seem small compared to other tournaments '
             "such as the Indian Premier League and Australia\\'s Big Bash "
             'League, but the PCB believes such deals will become more '
             'lucrative once the PSL is fully hosted in Pakistan.  Only eight '
             'out of 34 games have been held in Pakistan this year with the '
             'rest being played in the UAE, where the Pakistan national team '
             "plays the majority of its \\'home\\' matches.  The PCB is "
             'expecting to have at least half of the tournament in Pakistan '
             'from next year.  Three of the eight games this year were '
             'originally scheduled in Lahore but they were shifted to Karachi '
             "as Lahore\\'s airspace was closed in wake of the recent "
             'India-Pakistan border skirmishes.  In terms of support, nearly '
             '200,000 people will have been at the National Stadium across the '
             'seven days the PSL has been in town while, perhaps more '
             "impressively, 90% of the television audience in the nation\\'s "
             'capital, Islamabad, watched the final between their team and and '
             'Peshawar last year.  ### Has the PSL unearthed any new talent?  '
             '\\n The final will be held at the National Stadium in Karachi  '
             'Pakistan is renowned for producing exciting cricketers and has '
             'continued to do so despite playing such little cricket at home '
             'for a decade.  In 2017, the national team won the Champions '
             "Trophy in England, while the nation\\'s T20 team are ranked "
             'number one in the world.  If anything, the PSL has accelerated '
             'the production line, with both Hasan Ali - the player of the '
             "tournament in Pakistan\\'s Champions Trophy success - and Fakhar "
             'Zaman, the man of the match in the final against India at The '
             'Oval, fast-tracked to the national side after impressive '
             'showings in the PSL.  This year, in particular, the tournament '
             'has been productive for fast bowlers.  A case in point is '
             'Mohammad Hasnain, an 18-year-old speedster who has been clocked '
             'at 94mph.  His nine wickets in six matches for Quetta '
             'Gladiators, at an average of 20.11, have resulted in a call-up '
             'to the national squad for the ODI series against Australia which '
             'starts in the UAE on 22 March.  Haris Rauf is another fast '
             'bowler who has been highly impressive. The 25-year- old has come '
             'through the development programme of Lahore Qalandars and taken '
             '11 wickets at 7.41 in the tournament.  \\n Prime minister Imran '
             'Khan - the former World Cup-winning all-rounder - wants to hold '
             'all of the 2020 PSL in Pakistan  Among spin bowling talent, '
             '19-year-old left-arm tweaker Umer Khan, who made his T20 debut '
             'in the PSL, has been a match-winner for Karachi Kings and '
             'appears to have the knack of getting big wickets.  Of his 15 '
             'wickets in the tournament, all are of batsmen in the top-five '
             'positions.  Shane Watson (twice), AB de Villiers, James Vince, '
             'Luke Ronchi and Shoaib Malik are some of the marquee players he '
             'has dismissed in his short career.  Livingstone, who is a '
             "team-mate of Umer, has been impressed with Pakistan\\'s bowling "
             'talent.  "I am surprised how good the bowling has been in the '
             "PSL. I haven\\'t played in other leagues so I can\\'t compare it "
             'with them but compared to England the bowling has been '
             'definitely better in this competition," said Livingstone.  The '
             'tournament concludes on Sunday when Quetta Gladiators, led by '
             'Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, meet Peshawar Zalmi, for whom '
             'England all-rounder Chris Jordan took three wickets in '
             "Friday\\'s final eliminator against Islamabad United.  And for "
             'those three or four hours while the game is ongoing, the nation '
             'will stop and watch the cricket.  Could it be that T20 - so long '
             'seen as a threat to Test cricket - offers the longer format a '
             'route back into Pakistan? The world of cricket certainly hopes '
             'so.  \\n',

             'BBC Sport website      Jofra Archer says England fans have still '
             'to see him perform at his best.  The 24-year-old fast bowler, '
             'born in Barbados to a British father, qualified to play for '
             'England in March.  Capable of bowling in excess of 90mph, Archer '
             "was selected in England\\'s World Cup squad after playing only "
             'three one-day internationals.  "There\\\'s always more to come," '
             'he told BBC Sport. "I strive to keep getting better, personally, '
             'and the team will get better as well."  Archer benefited from a '
             "change in the England and Wales Cricket Board\\'s eligibility "
             'criteria.  Until the ECB moved more closely in line with '
             'International Cricket Council guidelines in November, it '

             'Twenty20 leagues in India and Australia.  "International cricket '
             'doesn\\\'t feel much different," said the Sussex player. "My '
             "role hasn\\'t changed whatever team I\\'ve gone into, so I\\'ve "
             'been lucky.  "It doesn\\\'t feel like a big transition. I\\\'ve '
             'been put in pressure situations a few times playing out in '
             'India, so I think I know what to look forward to if it '
             'happens."  Archer made his England debut in a victory over '
             'Ireland in Dublin, but gave a greater glimpse of his ability '
             'with the ball during a hostile spell in the first ODI against '
             'Pakistan at The Oval.  In recent years, England have often '
             'suffered through a lack of raw pace, particularly in Tests '
             'played away from home.  Asked about the heightened interest '
             'surrounding the skills that he now brings to the England team, '

             'runs_   Scorecard. Table. Schedule      Ben Stokes and Jofra '
             'Archer lit up The Oval to ensure England defeated South Africa '
             'and got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start.  '
             'Regularly bowling in excess of 90mph, Archer - playing only his '
             'fourth one-day international - took 3-27 and hit Hashim Amla on '
             'the helmet to force him to temporarily retire hurt.  After '
             'Stokes took an amazing one-handed catch on the boundary to '
             'dismiss Andile Phehlukwayo, South Africa were dismissed for 207 '
             'to lose by 104 runs.  Stokes earlier made 89 and Jason Roy, Joe '
             'Root and Eoin Morgan hit half- centuries to take England to '
             '311-8, a total that seemed no better than par.  Quinton de '
             "Kock\\'s 68 had South Africa in the hunt at 129-2, but he pulled "
             'Liam Plunkett to long leg to become the first of three wickets '
             'to fall for 15 runs.  When Stokes took two wickets in two balls, '
             'the world number ones and favourites completed an ideal start to '
             'the tournament.  In a competition where the 10 teams play each '
             'other once to determine the semi-finalists, the hosts travel to '
             'Nottingham to meet Pakistan at Trent Bridge on Monday.  South '
             'Africa, who showed enough with the ball to suggest they will '
             'contend for the semis, are back at The Oval on Sunday to take on '
             "Bangladesh.  ### England\\'s examination  \\n \\n "
             "\\'Incredible\\' Stokes catch removes Phehlukwayo\\n  \\n  "
             'England have been building to this competition for the four '
             'years since their dismal first-round exit at the last World Cup, '
             'sweeping all before them mainly thanks to their power-packed '
             'batting line-up.  But for three-quarters of a day that began '
             'with the Duke of Sussex opening the tournament, they were in '
             'danger of being upset by a well-drilled South Africa.  Indeed, '
             'on a slow pitch that produced intriguing rather than '
             'entertaining cricket, this was at times a low-key start to the '
             'tournament. Under grey skies even the crowd was subdued for long '
             'periods.  The exceptions to all of this were Archer and Stokes. '
             'For Archer, pace, aggression and hostility made it seem like a '
             'wicket was likely every time he had the ball in his hand.  '
             'However, the moment of the day belonged to Stokes, who took the '
             'most incredible catch, one that is unlikely to be bettered '
             'throughout the whole tournament.  As Phehlukwayo swept Adil '
             'Rashid towards the mid-wicket boundary, the ball seemed to be '
             'too high for Stokes to reach.  He leapt, flinging himself '
             'backwards with his right arm outstretched. As he clung on in one '
             'hand, the crowd gasped and his team-mates mobbed him for '
             'disbelieving celebrations.  \\n \\n Archer takes first World Cup '
             'wicket to make England breakthrough\\n  \\n  ### Archer leads '
             'England attack  Born in Barbados to a British father, Archer '
             'only qualified to play for England in March and here showed '
             'exactly why he was fast-tracked into the World Cup squad.  The '
             'wickets he took were all, at least in some part, down to his '
             'pace. After Amla took a nasty blow to the grille, Aiden Markram '
             'fended to slip and Faf du Plessis hooked to long leg.  With '
             'South Africa in danger of subsiding, De Kock added 85 with '
             'Rassie van der Dussen. Both had moments of fortune - Rashid '
             'looked to have bowled De Kock only for the bails not to come '
             'off, while Van der Dussen was dropped by wicketkeeper Jos '
             "Buttler.  \\n \\n Watch De Kock\\'s amazing escape after ball "
             'hits stumps\\n  \\n  The game turned after De Kock helped a '
             'short ball from Plunkett to Root at long leg. JP Duminy holed '
             "out off Moeen and Dwaine Pretorius was run out by Stokes\\' "
             'bullet throw from the deep as three wickets fell in 21 balls.  '
             'Archer returned to remove Van der Dussen with another short ball '
             'and, though Amla came back before gloving Plunkett behind, '
             'Stokes took over.  First came the wonder catch, then the wickets '
             'of Kagiso Rabada and Imran Tahir completed an impressive England '
             'bowling and fielding display.  ### England work to winning '
             'total  For a variety of reasons - the control of the South '
             'Africa bowlers, the sluggish nature of the pitch and maybe even '
             'a few nerves - this was not the free-scoring England of the past '
             'four years.  The tone was set by a clever piece of captaincy '
             'from Du Plessis. Leg-spinner Tahir was chosen to open the '
             'bowling and Jonny Bairstow edged his second ball behind to '
             'become the first opener to get a golden duck in the first '
             'innings of a World Cup tournament.  To their credit, England '
             'steadied. Roy and Root added 106 and, after they both fell in '
             'the space of four balls, Morgan and Stokes shared 106 of their '
             'own.  Roy played powerful drives while Root scored almost '
             'exclusively off his pads. Morgan pulled and drove, playing the '
             'aggressor in his stand with Stokes until he was athletically '
             'caught by a diving Markram at long-on off Tahir.  Stokes began '
             'calmly - his first 31 runs came from 36 balls - but he gradually '
             "upped his scoring. Still, the biggest blow to England\\'s late "
             'charge came when Buttler dragged on to his stumps.  In the face '
             "of some intelligent South Africa bowling, England\\'s assault "
             'never materialised, but their total proved to be more than '
             "adequate.  \\n \\n \\'What a way to bring up a 50\\' - Stokes\\' "
             "\\'cheeky\\' four\\n  \\n  ### \\'A fantastic start\\' - "
             'reaction   **England all-rounder Ben Stokes on BBC Test Match '
             'Special:** "I\\\'m sure there were a few nerves kicking around - '
             "I\\'ve not felt like that in a long time when we arrived at the "
             'ground. To come away with a win is a fantastic start.  '
             '"That\\\'s the best we\\\'ve fielded in about two or three '
             'years. The amount of runs we saved was absolutely brilliant."   '
             '**Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:** "Any '
             "team\\'s success is generally geared around the all-rounder. Ben "
             'Stokes finding form in the first game of the World Cup is a huge '
             'boost for England.  "His innings with the bat was really smart - '
             "and that\\'s the way I\\'d describe this England performance: "
             'smart."   **England captain Eoin Morgan:** "We were very good '
             "today. We were good as a batting unit even though we couldn\\'t "
             'score a considerable total, which was our Plan A.  "But we felt '
             "that the score we had on the board was above average. We won\\'t "
             'have days like this every time.  "Jofra Archer bowled fast and '
             'accurate on a slow pitch it was outstanding from a young guy. '
             "He\\'s taking everything in his stride. It\\'s very exciting.   "
             '**South Africa captain Faf du Plessis:** "We were outplayed in '
             'all three departments. I thought 300 was par - we were bowling '
             'cutters, but there were some really good batting performances '
             'from England.  "Hashim Amla is OK now. He was all over the place '
             'when he came off the field but hopefully he is OK for the next '
             'game."   **Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith on the TMS '
             'podcast:** "All of our fears came up today - the balance and the '
             'batting are the weak parts for South Africa. Chasing just over '
             '300 against a very good team, they never really looked in it."  '

             'Archer lit up The Oval to ensure England defeated South Africa '
             'and got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start.  '
             'Regularly bowling in excess of 90mph, Archer - playing only his '
             'fourth one-day international - took 3-27 and hit Hashim Amla on '
             'the helmet to force him to temporarily retire hurt.  After '
             'Stokes took an amazing one-handed catch on the boundary to '
             'dismiss Andile Phehlukwayo, South Africa were dismissed for 207 '
             'to lose by 104 runs.  Stokes earlier made 89 and Jason Roy, Joe '
             'Root and Eoin Morgan hit half- centuries to take England to '
             '311-8, a total that seemed no better than par.  Quinton de '
             "Kock\\'s 68 had South Africa in the hunt at 129-2, but he pulled "
             'Liam Plunkett to long leg to become the first of three wickets '
             'to fall for 15 runs.  When Stokes took two wickets in two balls, '
             'the world number ones and favourites completed an ideal start to '
             'the tournament.  In a competition where the 10 teams play each '
             'other once to determine the semi-finalists, the hosts travel to '
             'Nottingham to meet Pakistan at Trent Bridge on Monday.  South '
             'Africa, who showed enough with the ball to suggest they will '
             'contend for the semis, are back at The Oval on Sunday to take on '
             "Bangladesh.  ### England\\'s examination  \\n \\n "
             "\\'Incredible\\' Stokes catch removes Phehlukwayo\\n  \\n  "
             'England have been building to this competition for the four '
             'years since their dismal first-round exit at the last World Cup, '
             'sweeping all before them mainly thanks to their power-packed '
             'batting line-up.  But for three-quarters of a day that began '
             'with the Duke of Sussex opening the tournament, they were in '
             'danger of being upset by a well-drilled South Africa.  Indeed, '
             'on a slow pitch that produced intriguing rather than '
             'entertaining cricket, this was at times a low-key start to the '
             'tournament. Under grey skies even the crowd was subdued for long '
             'periods.  The exceptions to all of this were Archer and Stokes. '
             'For Archer, pace, aggression and hostility made it seem like a '
             'wicket was likely every time he had the ball in his hand.  '
             'However, the moment of the day belonged to Stokes, who took the '
             'most incredible catch, one that is unlikely to be bettered '
             'throughout the whole tournament.  As Phehlukwayo swept Adil '
             'Rashid towards the mid-wicket boundary, the ball seemed to be '
             'too high for Stokes to reach.  He leapt, flinging himself '
             'backwards with his right arm outstretched. As he clung on in one '
             'hand, the crowd gasped and his team-mates mobbed him for '
             'disbelieving celebrations.  \\n \\n Archer takes first World Cup '
             'wicket to make England breakthrough\\n  \\n  ### Archer leads '
             'England attack  Born in Barbados to a British father, Archer '
             'only qualified to play for England in March and here showed '
             'exactly why he was fast-tracked into the World Cup squad.  The '
             'wickets he took were all, at least in some part, down to his '
             'pace. After Amla took a nasty blow to the grille, Aiden Markram '
             'fended to slip and Faf du Plessis hooked to long leg.  With '
             'South Africa in danger of subsiding, De Kock added 85 with '
             'Rassie van der Dussen. Both had moments of fortune - Rashid '
             'looked to have bowled De Kock only for the bails not to come '
             'off, while Van der Dussen was dropped by wicketkeeper Jos '
             "Buttler.  \\n \\n Watch De Kock\\'s amazing escape after ball "
             'hits stumps\\n  \\n  The game turned after De Kock helped a '
             'short ball from Plunkett to Root at long leg. JP Duminy holed '
             "out off Moeen and Dwaine Pretorius was run out by Stokes\\' "
             'bullet throw from the deep as three wickets fell in 21 balls.  '
             'Archer returned to remove Van der Dussen with another short ball '
             'and, though Amla came back before gloving Plunkett behind, '
             'Stokes took over.  First came the wonder catch, then the wickets '
             'of Kagiso Rabada and Imran Tahir completed an impressive England '
             'bowling and fielding display.  ### England work to winning '
             'total  For a variety of reasons - the control of the South '
             'Africa bowlers, the sluggish nature of the pitch and maybe even '
             'a few nerves - this was not the free-scoring England of the past '
             'four years.  The tone was set by a clever piece of captaincy '
             'from Du Plessis. Leg-spinner Tahir was chosen to open the '
             'bowling and Jonny Bairstow edged his second ball behind to '
             'become the first opener to get a golden duck in the first '
             'innings of a World Cup tournament.  To their credit, England '
             'steadied. Roy and Root added 106 and, after they both fell in '
             'the space of four balls, Morgan and Stokes shared 106 of their '
             'own.  Roy played powerful drives while Root scored almost '
             'exclusively off his pads. Morgan pulled and drove, playing the '
             'aggressor in his stand with Stokes until he was athletically '
             'caught by a diving Markram at long-on off Tahir.  Stokes began '
             'calmly - his first 31 runs came from 36 balls - but he gradually '
             "upped his scoring. Still, the biggest blow to England\\'s late "
             'charge came when Buttler dragged on to his stumps.  In the face '
             "of some intelligent South Africa bowling, England\\'s assault "
             'never materialised, but their total proved to be more than '
             "adequate.  \\n \\n \\'What a way to bring up a 50\\' - Stokes\\' "
             "\\'cheeky\\' four\\n  \\n  ### \\'A fantastic start\\' - "
             'reaction   **England all-rounder Ben Stokes on BBC Test Match '
             'Special:** "I\\\'m sure there were a few nerves kicking around - '
             "I\\'ve not felt like that in a long time when we arrived at the "
             'ground. To come away with a win is a fantastic start.  '
             '"That\\\'s the best we\\\'ve fielded in about two or three '
             'years. The amount of runs we saved was absolutely brilliant."   '
             '**Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:** "Any '
             "team\\'s success is generally geared around the all-rounder. Ben "
             'Stokes finding form in the first game of the World Cup is a huge '
             'boost for England.  "His innings with the bat was really smart - '
             "and that\\'s the way I\\'d describe this England performance: "
             'smart."   **England captain Eoin Morgan:** "We were very good '
             "today. We were good as a batting unit even though we couldn\\'t "
             'score a considerable total, which was our Plan A.  "But we felt '
             "that the score we had on the board was above average. We won\\'t "
             'have days like this every time.  "Jofra Archer bowled fast and '
             'accurate on a slow pitch it was outstanding from a young guy. '
             "He\\'s taking everything in his stride. It\\'s very exciting.   "
             '**South Africa captain Faf du Plessis:** "We were outplayed in '
             'all three departments. I thought 300 was par - we were bowling '
             'cutters, but there were some really good batting performances '
             'from England.  "Hashim Amla is OK now. He was all over the place '
             'when he came off the field but hopefully he is OK for the next '
             'game."   **Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith on the TMS '
             'podcast:** "All of our fears came up today - the balance and the '
             'batting are the weak parts for South Africa. Chasing just over '
             '300 against a very good team, they never really looked in it."  '

             'Pakistan   ---    **Venue:** Trent Bridge, Nottingham **Date:** '
             '3 June **Time:** 10:30 BST    **Coverage:** Ball-by-ball '
             'commentary on BBC Test Match Special. Live text commentary and '
             'in-play highlights on the BBC Sport website.      All-rounder '
             'Ben Stokes is capable of doing "awesome" things for the England '
             'team and for cricket itself, says captain Eoin Morgan.  Stokes '
             "starred in England\\'s opening World Cup win over South Africa, "
             'scoring 89, taking two wickets, completing a run-out and, most '
             'memorably, holding an astonishing one-handed catch on the '
             'boundary.  "Everyone from five years old to 75 who watched the '
             'game can relate to having one of those days where you do nothing '
             'wrong," Morgan told BBC Sport.  "When he puts in a performance '
             'like that it is great, not only for English cricket, but for the '
             'sport."  On Monday Stokes will be part of the England side who '
             'meet Pakistan in their second World Cup match.  The game is at '
             'Trent Bridge, where Stokes played his first international after '
             'being cleared of affray last summer for his part in altercation '
             'outside a Bristol nightclub in September 2017.  When it was put '
             'to Morgan that Stokes has not been as combative on the field '
             'since the Bristol incident, he said: "I certainly haven\\\'t '
             'seen it as you guys have. He has been unbelievable since then.  '
             '"His work ethic, his mentality around the changing room and his '
             'performance have all worked towards what happened against South '
             'Africa.  "He did it with a great temperament, which is fantastic '
             'to see because he is maturing a huge amount as a cricketer."  '
             "And Morgan said Stokes\\' impressive start to the World Cup was "
             'a further boost for an England side that began the tournament as '
             'favourites.  "When his confidence is high, it rubs off on other '
             'guys," said Morgan. "It\\\'s infectious in the changing room and '
             'on the field.  "He\\\'ll want the ball; he\\\'ll want to be in '
             "the crucial moment with the bat when we\\'re losing wickets or "
             'need to up the rate. In important parts of the game, it makes '
             'him an important asset."  England beat Pakistan 4-0 in a series '
             "before the World Cup began and then saw Sarfaraz Ahmed\\'s men "
             'blown away by West Indies at Trent Bridge on Friday.  With short '
             'bowling already playing a huge part in the competition, England '
             'could add the extra pace of Mark Wood to their side.  "We saw '
             'the wicket the other day went through with more pace and exposed '
             'Pakistan, more so with the short ball," said Morgan.  "Pakistan '
             "are a side we\\'ve played a lot against recently and they are "
             'extremely dangerous any day of the week. We are preparing for '
             "their \\'A\\' game to turn up and will try to impose our \\'A\\' "
             'game."  Pakistan have lost 11 consecutive one-day '
             'internationals, but bowling coach Azhar Mahmood said it would '
             'not be an upset if they beat England, the top- ranked side in '
             'the world.  "We can beat them," he said. "In the one-day series, '
             'we were not that far from England.  "We know what England can do '

 'newsText': '\\n \\n  Australia beat New Zealand in the World Cup final on '
             'Sunday to complete a tournament littered with outstanding '
             'individual performances.  In advance of the showpiece, the Test '
             'Match Special experts got their heads together to pick their '
             'team of the tournament.  The selectors comprised chairman '

             'although there were three Englishmen on the panel, '
             'unsurprisingly not a single England player made their team.  The '
             "International Cricket Council\\'s team of the tournament, named "
             'one day after the final, featured exactly the same 11 players, '
             "with Zimbabwe\\'s Brendan Taylor as 12th man.  Take a look at "
             'the final XI, and have your say in the comments section below or '
             'via #bbcworldcupXI. __  Listen to a Test Match Special podcast '
             'of the team of the tournament debate.  ### 1) Brendon McCullum '
             '(New Zealand, captain)  \\n \\n  **Runs: 328, Average: 36.44, '
             "Strike Rate: 188.50**  Explosive. It\\'s a powerful word, but "
             "one that still doesn\\'t do full justice to the incredible "
             "impact of New Zealand\\'s captain at the top of the order. He "
             'mauled Steven Finn in the group phase, but it was his ruthless '
             'dismantling of South Africa paceman Dale Steyn in the semi-final '
             "that provided one of the tournament\\'s most electrifying "
             'episodes.  ### 2) Martin Guptill (New Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Runs: '
             '547, Average: 68.37, Strike Rate: 104.58**  On the rare '
             "occasions when McCullum hasn\\'t fired, Guptill invariably has. "
             'He ended a patchy run of form with 105 in a tight run chase '
             "against Bangladesh, then shattered Chris Gayle\\'s record for "
             'the highest World Cup score with an astonishing 237 not out in '
             'the quarter-final victory over West Indies.  ### 3) Kumar '
             'Sangakkara (Sri Lanka, wicketkeeper)  \\n \\n  **Runs: 541, '
             'Average: 108.20, Strike Rate 105.87**  How do you replace the '
             'irreplaceable? Kumar Sangakkara bowed out of one-day cricket by '
             'becoming the first player to score hundreds in four successive '
             'World Cup matches. A master of making every ball count, his 117 '
             'not out against England was a study in controlled brutality.  '
             '### 4) Steve Smith (Australia)  \\n \\n  **Runs: 402, Average: '
             '67.00, Strike Rate: 91.57**  Unorthodox, but incredibly '
             'effective, Steve Smith has continued his golden Australian '
             "summer by becoming the lynchpin of his team\\'s batting line-up "
             'at the World Cup. He was the first Australian to score a World '
             'Cup semi-final hundred and the player to score at least 50 in '
             'five consecutive World Cup innings.  ### 5) AB de Villiers '
             '(South Africa)  \\n \\n  **Runs: 482, Average: 96.40, Strike '
             'Rate: 144.31**  A force of nature. De Villiers lived up to his '
             'billing as the most destructive batsman in the game with the '
             'fastest 150 in one-day history from 64 deliveries against West '
             'Indies. He followed that with blistering fifties against '
             'Pakistan, the UAE and New Zealand and was the epitome of energy '
             'and athleticism in the field.  ### 6) Glenn Maxwell (Australia)  '
             '\\n \\n  **Runs: 324, Average: 64.80, Strike Rate: 182.02, '
             'Wickets: 6, Average 36.33, Economy Rate: 5.73**  If Kevin '
             'Pietersen is the kind of player who empties the bars, Glenn '
             'Maxwell can turn a grown man sober. His 102 off 53 balls against '
             'Sri Lanka was an annihilation, while his handy off-spin has '
             'allowed Australia to play without a front-line spinner. The '
             "\\'Big Show\\' just got bigger.  ### 7) Corey Anderson (New "
             'Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Runs: 231, Average: 33.00, Strike Rate: '
             '108.45, Wickets: 14, Average: 16.71, Economy Rate: 6.47**  An '
             'exceptional all-round performance from the 24-year-old New '
             'Zealander with arms like tree trucks. Whether he was snaffling '
             'crucial wickets with his brisk left-arm seam bowling or crashing '
             'lower-order runs, he contributed something in every match and '
             'scored a crucial 58 in their semi-final win over South Africa.  '
             '### 8) Daniel Vettori (New Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Wickets: 15, '
             'Average: 20.46, Economy Rate: 4.04**  Even in his 20th year as a '
             'professional cricketer, Vettori remains a match- winner. He was '
             "the catalyst to Australia\\'s collapse in their riveting group "
             'game, by taking two crucial wickets in a miserly spell, and '
             'destroyed the part-timers of Afghanistan with extraordinary '
             'figures of 10-4-18-4. And rarely can a score of seven not out '
             "have been as telling as Vettori\\'s in the Kiwis\\' semi-final "
             'run chase.  ### 9) Mitchell Starc (Australia)  \\n \\n  '
             '**Wickets: 22, Average: 10.18, Economy Rate 3.50**  A one-man '
             'wrecking ball, Mitchell Starc eclipsed his more celebrated '
             'team-mate Mitchell Johnson with devastating left-arm pace '
             'bowling at the beginning and end of every innings. He has taken '
             'at least two wickets in every match at a truly remarkable '
             'economy rate of 3.65 and will be hoping to repeat his six- '
             'wicket haul against New Zealand when the teams meet again on '
             'Sunday.  ### 10) Trent Boult (New Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Wickets: '
             '22, Average: 16.86, Economy Rate: 4.36**  Boult has underlined '
             'his status as one of the most exciting young bowlers in '
             'international cricket by spearheading the New Zealand attack '
             'with aplomb. The left-arm quick has a tournament-leading 21 '
             'wickets and has bowled a staggering 14 maidens - twice as many '
             'as anyone else in the World Cup.  ### 11) Morne Morkel (South '
             'Africa)  \\n \\n  **Wickets: 17, Average: 17.58, Economy rate '
             '4.38**  Like Starc, Morkel has outbowled an illustrious '
             'compatriot, taking six more wickets than Steyn in South '
             "Africa\\'s run to the semi-finals. A consistent menace, his "
             "tears at the conclusion of the Proteas\\' agonising defeat by "
             'New Zealand told of a man who had left everything out on the '
             'field.  ### 12th man: Mohammed Shami (India)  \\n \\n  '
             '**Wickets: 17, Average: 17.29, Economy rate: 4.81**  The '
             'standout performer in an India team that took all 10 wickets in '
             'every match until the semi-final. He claimed three or more '
             'wickets in four of his first six matches but came unstuck '
             'against Australia and was narrowly edged out by Morkel in the '
             'final XI.  \\n',

             'Sri Lanka was an annihilation, while his handy off-spin has '
             'allowed Australia to play without a front-line spinner. The '
             "\\'Big Show\\' just got bigger.  ### 7) Corey Anderson (New "
             'Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Runs: 231, Average: 33.00, Strike Rate: '
             '108.45, Wickets: 14, Average: 16.71, Economy Rate: 6.47**  An '
             'exceptional all-round performance from the 24-year-old New '
             'Zealander with arms like tree trucks. Whether he was snaffling '
             'crucial wickets with his brisk left-arm seam bowling or crashing '
             'lower-order runs, he contributed something in every match and '
             'scored a crucial 58 in their semi-final win over South Africa.  '
             '### 8) Daniel Vettori (New Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Wickets: 15, '
             'Average: 20.46, Economy Rate: 4.04**  Even in his 20th year as a '
             'professional cricketer, Vettori remains a match- winner. He was '
             "the catalyst to Australia\\'s collapse in their riveting group "
             'game, by taking two crucial wickets in a miserly spell, and '
             'destroyed the part-timers of Afghanistan with extraordinary '
             'figures of 10-4-18-4. And rarely can a score of seven not out '
             "have been as telling as Vettori\\'s in the Kiwis\\' semi-final "
             'run chase.  ### 9) Mitchell Starc (Australia)  \\n \\n  '
             '**Wickets: 22, Average: 10.18, Economy Rate 3.50**  A one-man '
             'wrecking ball, Mitchell Starc eclipsed his more celebrated '
             'team-mate Mitchell Johnson with devastating left-arm pace '
             'bowling at the beginning and end of every innings. He has taken '
             'at least two wickets in every match at a truly remarkable '
             'economy rate of 3.65 and will be hoping to repeat his six- '
             'wicket haul against New Zealand when the teams meet again on '
             'Sunday.  ### 10) Trent Boult (New Zealand)  \\n \\n  **Wickets: '
             '22, Average: 16.86, Economy Rate: 4.36**  Boult has underlined '
             'his status as one of the most exciting young bowlers in '
             'international cricket by spearheading the New Zealand attack '
             'with aplomb. The left-arm quick has a tournament-leading 21 '
             'wickets and has bowled a staggering 14 maidens - twice as many '
             'as anyone else in the World Cup.  ### 11) Morne Morkel (South '
             'Africa)  \\n \\n  **Wickets: 17, Average: 17.58, Economy rate '
             '4.38**  Like Starc, Morkel has outbowled an illustrious '
             'compatriot, taking six more wickets than Steyn in South '
             "Africa\\'s run to the semi-finals. A consistent menace, his "
             "tears at the conclusion of the Proteas\\' agonising defeat by "
             'New Zealand told of a man who had left everything out on the '
             'field.  ### 12th man: Mohammed Shami (India)  \\n \\n  '
             '**Wickets: 17, Average: 17.29, Economy rate: 4.81**  The '
             'standout performer in an India team that took all 10 wickets in '
             'every match until the semi-final. He claimed three or more '
             'wickets in four of his first six matches but came unstuck '
             'against Australia and was narrowly edged out by Morkel in the '
             'final XI.  \\n',

             'BBC Test Match Special   ---   "People will say McCullum went '
             "too hard too soon, but that\\'s the way he took New Zealand to "
             "the final. They just came up against a better team - you\\'ve "
             'got to be very good to keep 150kph yorkers out like those Starc '
             'was bowling. McCullum has mainly been doing well against '
             'right-arm over bowlers."      McCullum was bowled third ball by '
             'Mitchell Starc, but the opener said he had no misgivings about '
             'his typically aggressive approach.  "Hadds [Australia '

             'crack," he said. "I said: \\\'Too right I am\\\'.  "Starc was a '
             'bit too good for me today. He deserves the man of the '
             'tournament."  McCullum pinpointed the loss of three wickets for '
             "one run at the start of New Zealand\\'s batting powerplay as a "
             'crucial point in the game.  "We got ourselves back in the game '
             'at three for 150," he said. "But Australia, as they do, put us '
             'back under pressure.  "Had we got 260, we might have had a '

             'crack," he said. "I said: \\\'Too right I am\\\'.  "Starc was a '
             'bit too good for me today. He deserves the man of the '
             'tournament."  McCullum pinpointed the loss of three wickets for '
             "one run at the start of New Zealand\\'s batting powerplay as a "
             'crucial point in the game.  "We got ourselves back in the game '
             'at three for 150," he said. "But Australia, as they do, put us '
             'back under pressure.  "Had we got 260, we might have had a '
             'different conversation now."  New Zealand\\\'s next assignment '
             'is to face England in Test and one-day international series this '
             'summer, and McCullum believes the Black Caps will benefit from '
             'their run at the World Cup.  "We\\\'re heading in the right '
             'direction," he said. "We have a group prepared to buy into team '
             'plans and play an aggressive brand of cricket."  "It\\\'s hard '
             "when you\\'ve lost a final, but we\\'re richer for the "
             'experience."  \\n',

                 b'es - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n Cricket World Cup 2015: Michael Clarke dedicates win to '
             "Phillip Hughes  Captain Michael Clarke dedicated Australia\\'s "
             'fifth World Cup title to his former team-mate Phillip Hughes.  '
             'Batsman Hughes died at the age of 25 after being struck on the '
             'neck by a bouncer in Sydney in November.  "I\\\'m sure everybody '
             'on this stage will say we played this World Cup with 16 '
             'players," said Clarke after his team\\\'s seven-wicket win over '
             'New Zealand.  "Hughesy used to party as good as any of them so I '
             'guarantee we\\\'ll celebrate hard tonight."  After Australia '
             'bowled out New Zealand for 183, Clarke led from the front with '
             '74 as the hosts knocked off the runs in 33.1 overs at a packed '
             'Melbourne Cricket Ground.  \\n Cricket World Cup 2015: Fitting '
             'end for Michael Clarke - Michael Vaughan  Clarke, who read a '
             "moving eulogy at Hughes\\'s funeral, batted with a black armband "
             "carrying the player\\'s initials in his final one-day "
             'international.  "As you can see it\\\'s got PH on it. I\\\'ll '
             'wear it every game I play for Australia," added Clarke.  "I '
             "think for everybody in Australian cricket it\\'s been really "
             'tough few months. Tonight is certainly dedicated to our little '
             'brother and our team-mate Phillip Hughes."  Paceman Mitchell '
             'Starc set the tone for a blistering bowling performance in the '
             'first over of the match when he bowled opposing captain Brendon '
             'McCullum.  Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner weighed in with '
             'three wickets apiece as the Kiwis were bowled out in 45 overs.  '
             '\\n Phillip Hughes played 26 Tests and 25 one-day internationals '
             'for Australia  "I think our bowlers have won us the World Cup," '
             'said Clarke. "I think our batters have stood up and grabbed '
             'their opportunities, but I think our bowling performances in '
             'every single game have been exceptional, probably none better '
             'than today."  David Warner cracked 45 at the top of the Aussie '
             'order before Clarke and Steve Smith (56 not out) steered the '
             'them to a comfortable win to the delight of a record 93,000 '
             'crowd.  BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew   ---   '
             '"Australia\\\'s depth of fast bowling has an Englishman quaking '
             'in his boots when thinking about what might happen in the '
             'Ashes."      "We\\\'re really proud, it\\\'s a wonderful '
             'achievement," added Clarke.  "It\\\'s a great thing just to make '
             'a World Cup final, but to be able to win in your own back yard '
             'in front of your family and friends is extremely special."  '
             'Co-hosts New Zealand were competing in their first final but had '
             'won all eight of their matches to reach the showpiece.  Michael '
             'Clarke in numbers   ---   Date of birth: 2 April, 1981| ODIs: '
             '245   Runs: 7,981| Average: 44.58   Highest score: 130| 100s: '
             '8      "The New Zealand team deserve a lot of credit," said '
             'Clarke. "They\\\'re always a tough team to beat it seems in any '
             'sporting event. Australia v New Zealand is always an exciting '
             'contest and tonight was no different."  On his future, Clarke '
             'added: "It\\\'s been an honour and a privilege to represent my '
             'country in both Test and one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket.  '
             '"The time is right for me to walk away from one-day cricket, but '
             'I\\\'ll keep playing Test cricket."  ### Player of the '
             'tournament Mitchell Starc  "I think we\\\'ve watched McCullum a '
             "fair bit through the tournament be pretty destructive. He\\'s "
             "been a key player for them right from the beginning, and he\\'s "
             'been fantastic for the Kiwis to get them off to great starts.  '
             '"I think after that game in New Zealand we knew we had to sort '
             "of assess him as he went because he\\'s very unpredictable. I "
             'think personally it was a bit of a planning game with Craig '
             'McDermott about just bowling pace and yorkers to him first up, '
             "and I\\'m not sure how that first one missed, but lucky the "
             "third one hit. There\\'s a lot of luck involved, but just nice "
             'to see that plan come off."  ### Australia batsman Steve Smith  '
             '"I thought it was a fitting farewell for Pup (Michael Clarke). I '
             'wish he was there with me at the end.  "We said we wanted to '
             'play our best game at the end of the tournament and to win it '
             'three down is unbelievable."  ### Opener Aaron Finch  "You '
             'always dream about this as a kid and for it to finally happen, '
             'especially at the MCG, is amazing. When you get in a tournament '
             "it\\'s all about peaking at the right time, and the way we\\'ve "
             'played today has been a credit to everybody."  \\n',

 'newsHeadline': b'World Cup 2015: Michael Clarke dedicates win to Phillip Hugh'
                 b'es - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n Cricket World Cup 2015: Michael Clarke dedicates win to '
             "Phillip Hughes  Captain Michael Clarke dedicated Australia\\'s "
             'fifth World Cup title to his former team-mate Phillip Hughes.  '
             'Batsman Hughes died at the age of 25 after being struck on the '
             'neck by a bouncer in Sydney in November.  "I\\\'m sure everybody '
             'on this stage will say we played this World Cup with 16 '
             'players," said Clarke after his team\\\'s seven-wicket win over '
             'New Zealand.  "Hughesy used to party as good as any of them so I '
             'guarantee we\\\'ll celebrate hard tonight."  After Australia '
             'bowled out New Zealand for 183, Clarke led from the front with '
             '74 as the hosts knocked off the runs in 33.1 overs at a packed '
             'Melbourne Cricket Ground.  \\n Cricket World Cup 2015: Fitting '
             'end for Michael Clarke - Michael Vaughan  Clarke, who read a '
             "moving eulogy at Hughes\\'s funeral, batted with a black armband "
             "carrying the player\\'s initials in his final one-day "
             'international.  "As you can see it\\\'s got PH on it. I\\\'ll '
             'wear it every game I play for Australia," added Clarke.  "I '
             "think for everybody in Australian cricket it\\'s been really "
             'tough few months. Tonight is certainly dedicated to our little '
             'brother and our team-mate Phillip Hughes."  Paceman Mitchell '
             'Starc set the tone for a blistering bowling performance in the '
             'first over of the match when he bowled opposing captain Brendon '
             'McCullum.  Mitchell Johnson and James Faulkner weighed in with '
             'three wickets apiece as the Kiwis were bowled out in 45 overs.  '
             '\\n Phillip Hughes played 26 Tests and 25 one-day internationals '
             'for Australia  "I think our bowlers have won us the World Cup," '
             'said Clarke. "I think our batters have stood up and grabbed '
             'their opportunities, but I think our bowling performances in '
             'every single game have been exceptional, probably none better '
             'than today."  David Warner cracked 45 at the top of the Aussie '
             'order before Clarke and Steve Smith (56 not out) steered the '
             'them to a comfortable win to the delight of a record 93,000 '
             'crowd.  BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew   ---   '
             '"Australia\\\'s depth of fast bowling has an Englishman quaking '
             'in his boots when thinking about what might happen in the '
             'Ashes."      "We\\\'re really proud, it\\\'s a wonderful '
             'achievement," added Clarke.  "It\\\'s a great thing just to make '
             'a World Cup final, but to be able to win in your own back yard '
             'in front of your family and friends is extremely special."  '
             'Co-hosts New Zealand were competing in their first final but had '
             'won all eight of their matches to reach the showpiece.  Michael '
             'Clarke in numbers   ---   Date of birth: 2 April, 1981| ODIs: '
             '245   Runs: 7,981| Average: 44.58   Highest score: 130| 100s: '
             '8      "The New Zealand team deserve a lot of credit," said '
             'Clarke. "They\\\'re always a tough team to beat it seems in any '
             'sporting event. Australia v New Zealand is always an exciting '
             'contest and tonight was no different."  On his future, Clarke '
             'added: "It\\\'s been an honour and a privilege to represent my '
             'country in both Test and one-day cricket and Twenty20 cricket.  '
             '"The time is right for me to walk away from one-day cricket, but '
             'I\\\'ll keep playing Test cricket."  ### Player of the '
             'tournament Mitchell Starc  "I think we\\\'ve watched McCullum a '
             "fair bit through the tournament be pretty destructive. He\\'s "
             "been a key player for them right from the beginning, and he\\'s "
             'been fantastic for the Kiwis to get them off to great starts.  '
             '"I think after that game in New Zealand we knew we had to sort '
             "of assess him as he went because he\\'s very unpredictable. I "
             'think personally it was a bit of a planning game with Craig '
             'McDermott about just bowling pace and yorkers to him first up, '
             "and I\\'m not sure how that first one missed, but lucky the "
             "third one hit. There\\'s a lot of luck involved, but just nice "
             'to see that plan come off."  ### Australia batsman Steve Smith  '
             '"I thought it was a fitting farewell for Pup (Michael Clarke). I '
             'wish he was there with me at the end.  "We said we wanted to '
             'play our best game at the end of the tournament and to win it '
             'three down is unbelievable."  ### Opener Aaron Finch  "You '
             'always dream about this as a kid and for it to finally happen, '
             'especially at the MCG, is amazing. When you get in a tournament '
             "it\\'s all about peaking at the right time, and the way we\\'ve "
             'played today has been a credit to everybody."  \\n',

                 b'es - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n Johnson and Starc will be a twin left-arm pace spearhead '
             "against England in this summer\\'s Ashes  In the end, the best "
             'team won the World Cup. Once again, that team was Australia.  At '
             'the beginning, we had them as the favourites to win a fourth '
             'World Cup in five because of the depth in their squad and the '
             'advantage of playing all but one of their matches at home.  It '
             "wasn\\'t always easy and they had issues to overcome, talk "
             'surrounding the position of Michael Clarke and the fitness of '
             'James Faulkner.  But ultimately, a team showing typical '
             'Australian belief was celebrating at the Melbourne Cricket '
             'Ground after winning a one-sided final against New Zealand.  '
             'Their triumph was built on some hostile fast bowling, with '
             'captain Clarke identifying that his bowlers won his side the '
             'trophy.  One of his pacemen, Mitchell Starc, provided the '
             'defining moment of the final when the game was only five '
             'deliveries old.  Yes, you can say it was disappointing from '
             'Brendon McCullum, who was bowled from the third ball he faced by '
             "a Starc yorker after two wild swipes.  Australia\\'s pace "
             'bowling reserves   ---   | Tests| Wickets| Bowling Average   All '
             'except Faulkner & Cummins have played a Test since January '
             '2014   Mitchell Johnson| 64| 283| 27.84   Peter Siddle| 56| 192| '

             '35.44   James Pattinson| 13| 51| 27.07   Josh Hazlewood| 3| 12| '
             '29.33   Pat Cummins| 1| 7| 16.71   James Faulkner| 1| 6| '
             "16.33      I\\'ve always said McCullum should play in his "
             'ultra-aggressive manner, but today he failed to weigh up the '
             "options. If you\\'re going to play like that against the likes "
             'of Starc, you are not going to win many.  From there, Starc took '
             'complete control, continuing the fine form that resulted in 22 '
             'wickets across the competition and the man of the tournament '
             'award.  His success is what happens when a bowler gets into a '
             'rhythm, when everything clicks. He runs in beautifully and has '
             'swung the ball at very high pace.  As a left-armer, Starc '
             'naturally takes the ball back into the right-hander, stopping '
             'someone like McCullum from freeing his arms. He does that '
             'consistently, frequently throwing in those devastating yorkers.  '
             'I expect to see him bowling very well against England this '
             'summer. Before this tournament, we knew all about Mitchell '
             "Johnson, but now we are aware of Starc\\'s threat too.  \\n "
             'Mitchell Starc ended the tournament with the best ever World Cup '
             'bowling average (min 15 wkts): 22 wickets at 10.18  They have '
             'formed a trio with Josh Hazlewood, a strapping seam bowler who '
             'should also be suited to English conditions, and Australia also '
             'have the likes of Ryan Harris, James Pattinson and Patrick '
             'Cummins in reserve.  It is that depth of fast bowling that has '
             'an Englishman quaking in his boots when thinking about what '
             'might happen in the Ashes.  Granted, Australia have gaps to '
             "fill. There are questions about Clarke\\'s future, about who "
             'might open with David Warner and the strength of their spin '
             'bowling, but there is a gulf between the two teams.  Not only '
             'that, but the England team seem to be rebuilding on constantly '
             "shifting sands, while Australia\\'s foundations are "
             'rock-steady.  In the next two months, England must get their '
             'house in order, but that in itself could hamper their Ashes '
             'campaign.  Former England captain Michael Vaughan   ---   '
             '"They\\\'ve got the structure right here in Australia. There are '
             'enough English players out there who play an exciting brand of '
             'cricket, but my worry is the pace of the bowlers.   Even '
             'Bangladesh had two seamers bowling quicker than the England '
             'seamers. The pace element needs to arrive - the next World Cup '
             "is in England in 2019, and they\\'ve got four years to bring "
             'players into that side. Even take a backward step if you can '
             'bring some players in and get them used to it."      They need '
             'victories in the West Indies and at home against New Zealand to '
             'get used to winning again, which means the likes of James '
             'Anderson and Stuart Broad may not get the rest they need.  If '
             'the two spearheads of what looks to be an inferior attack are '
             "weary, then England will be at a big disadvantage. England\\'s "
             'batting line-up is taking shape, but to win Test matches you '
             'have to take 20 wickets.  Australia, led by the likes of Starc '
             'and Johnson, are more than capable of doing that. Only time will '
             'tell whether England have the same ability.  Having regained the '
             'Ashes and the World Cup in little over a year, Clarke will now '
             'turn his attention to doing something that Australia have not '
             'done for 14 years - win the Ashes in England.  Even if you have '
             'reservations about him, which some have, then you have to admire '
             'what he has achieved.  The death of Phillip Hughes would have '
             'been one of the lowest moments of his entire life, the emotions '
             'he must have felt extraordinary.  Yet, through a battle for '
             'fitness, he regained his place in the Australia team and led '
             'them to one of the highlights of his professional career.  He '

 'newsHeadline': b'Cricket World Cup 2015: Aussies have me quaking over the Ash'
                 b'es - BBC Sport',
 'newsText': '\\n Johnson and Starc will be a twin left-arm pace spearhead '
             "against England in this summer\\'s Ashes  In the end, the best "
             'team won the World Cup. Once again, that team was Australia.  At '
             'the beginning, we had them as the favourites to win a fourth '
             'World Cup in five because of the depth in their squad and the '
             'advantage of playing all but one of their matches at home.  It '
             "wasn\\'t always easy and they had issues to overcome, talk "
             'surrounding the position of Michael Clarke and the fitness of '
             'James Faulkner.  But ultimately, a team showing typical '
             'Australian belief was celebrating at the Melbourne Cricket '
             'Ground after winning a one-sided final against New Zealand.  '
             'Their triumph was built on some hostile fast bowling, with '
             'captain Clarke identifying that his bowlers won his side the '
             'trophy.  One of his pacemen, Mitchell Starc, provided the '
             'defining moment of the final when the game was only five '
             'deliveries old.  Yes, you can say it was disappointing from '
             'Brendon McCullum, who was bowled from the third ball he faced by '
             "a Starc yorker after two wild swipes.  Australia\\'s pace "
             'bowling reserves   ---   | Tests| Wickets| Bowling Average   All '
             'except Faulkner & Cummins have played a Test since January '
             '2014   Mitchell Johnson| 64| 283| 27.84   Peter Siddle| 56| 192| '
             '30.45   Ryan Harris| 27| 113| 23.52   Mitchell Starc| 15| 50| '
             '35.44   James Pattinson| 13| 51| 27.07   Josh Hazlewood| 3| 12| '
             '29.33   Pat Cummins| 1| 7| 16.71   James Faulkner| 1| 6| '
             "16.33      I\\'ve always said McCullum should play in his "
             'ultra-aggressive manner, but today he failed to weigh up the '
             "options. If you\\'re going to play like that against the likes "
             'of Starc, you are not going to win many.  From there, Starc took '
             'complete control, continuing the fine form that resulted in 22 '
             'wickets across the competition and the man of the tournament '
             'award.  His success is what happens when a bowler gets into a '
             'rhythm, when everything clicks. He runs in beautifully and has '
             'swung the ball at very high pace.  As a left-armer, Starc '
             'naturally takes the ball back into the right-hander, stopping '
             'someone like McCullum from freeing his arms. He does that '
             'consistently, frequently throwing in those devastating yorkers.  '
             'I expect to see him bowling very well against England this '
             'summer. Before this tournament, we knew all about Mitchell '
             "Johnson, but now we are aware of Starc\\'s threat too.  \\n "
             'Mitchell Starc ended the tournament with the best ever World Cup '
             'bowling average (min 15 wkts): 22 wickets at 10.18  They have '
             'formed a trio with Josh Hazlewood, a strapping seam bowler who '
             'should also be suited to English conditions, and Australia also '
             'have the likes of Ryan Harris, James Pattinson and Patrick '
             'Cummins in reserve.  It is that depth of fast bowling that has '
             'an Englishman quaking in his boots when thinking about what '
             'might happen in the Ashes.  Granted, Australia have gaps to '
             "fill. There are questions about Clarke\\'s future, about who "
             'might open with David Warner and the strength of their spin '
             'bowling, but there is a gulf between the two teams.  Not only '
             'that, but the England team seem to be rebuilding on constantly '
             "shifting sands, while Australia\\'s foundations are "
             'rock-steady.  In the next two months, England must get their '
             'house in order, but that in itself could hamper their Ashes '
             'campaign.  Former England captain Michael Vaughan   ---   '
             '"They\\\'ve got the structure right here in Australia. There are '
             'enough English players out there who play an exciting brand of '
             'cricket, but my worry is the pace of the bowlers.   Even '
             'Bangladesh had two seamers bowling quicker than the England '
             'seamers. The pace element needs to arrive - the next World Cup '
             "is in England in 2019, and they\\'ve got four years to bring "
             'players into that side. Even take a backward step if you can '
             'bring some players in and get them used to it."      They need '
             'victories in the West Indies and at home against New Zealand to '
             'get used to winning again, which means the likes of James '
             'Anderson and Stuart Broad may not get the rest they need.  If '
             'the two spearheads of what looks to be an inferior attack are '
             "weary, then England will be at a big disadvantage. England\\'s "
             'batting line-up is taking shape, but to win Test matches you '
             'have to take 20 wickets.  Australia, led by the likes of Starc '
             'and Johnson, are more than capable of doing that. Only time will '
             'tell whether England have the same ability.  Having regained the '
             'Ashes and the World Cup in little over a year, Clarke will now '
             'turn his attention to doing something that Australia have not '
             'done for 14 years - win the Ashes in England.  Even if you have '
             'reservations about him, which some have, then you have to admire '
             'what he has achieved.  The death of Phillip Hughes would have '
             'been one of the lowest moments of his entire life, the emotions '
             'he must have felt extraordinary.  Yet, through a battle for '
             'fitness, he regained his place in the Australia team and led '
             'them to one of the highlights of his professional career.  He '
             'batted very well in the final, but could not quite finish the '
             'job. That honour was left to Steven Smith, perhaps the next '
             'Australia captain, hitting the winning runs to seal their '
             'triumph.  Cricket World Cup roll of honour   ---   World Cup '

             'shown that the stricken cricketer needed surgery quickly to help '

             'to remove some of the skull from around his brain to help allow '
             'the brain to expand," added Grabs.  However, his recovery did '
             'not go as hoped.  "Over a period of the first 24 to 48 hours, he '
             'did not make very much improvement and unfortunately, as a '
             "consequence of the injury, he died,\\'\\' said Brukner.  \\n "

             'the entire cricket community, I would like to extend my sincere '
             'condolences to his family and friends."  Hughes, who had played '
             '26 Tests, **made his Test debut at the age of 20** against South '
             'Africa in 2009.  In only his second match, he became **the '
             'youngest batsman to post two centuries in a single Test.**   '
             '**He played county cricket for Hampshire, Middlesex and '
             'Worcestershire** and shared in what was at the time a world '
             'record 10th-wicket partnership of 163 with Ashton Agar against '
             'England in the 2013 Ashes series.  He has been tipped for a '
             'recall ahead of the upcoming series against India, which is due '
             'to start next week.  Cricket Australia had already decided to '
             'abandon the latest round of Sheffield Shield matches following '
             'the injury to Hughes.  After his death was announced, **cricket '
             'officials from Pakistan and New Zealand chose to postpone the '
             "second day\\'s play** in the third and final Test between the "
             'two countries.  "It\\\'s a sad day for cricket," Pakistan '
             'Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan said in a statement.  New '
             'Zealand Cricket chief executive David White added: "Cricket is a '

             'game of kinship, mateship and friendship; of camaraderie and '

             "**Thursday\\'s planned release of the 2015 county championship "
             'fixtures has also been postponed.**  The death of Hughes has '
             'inevitably sparked **further discussion about player safety in '
             'cricket** and the use of helmets.  "It\\\'s an incredibly safe '
             'game, but I think this will shake batsmen slightly out of what '
             'might have been complacency," said former England captain and '
             'opening batsman Michael Atherton.  "I wore the same helmet for '
             "10 years. I never changed it. I didn\\'t give it much thought "
             'really. If there is that kind of complacency that I was guilty '

             "Grabs, who treated Hughes at St Vincent\\'s,** said scans had "
             'shown that the stricken cricketer needed surgery quickly to help '
             'get the pressure down in the brain.  "He had extensive surgery '
             'to remove some of the skull from around his brain to help allow '
             'the brain to expand," added Grabs.  However, his recovery did '
             'not go as hoped.  "Over a period of the first 24 to 48 hours, he '
             'did not make very much improvement and unfortunately, as a '
             "consequence of the injury, he died,\\'\\' said Brukner.  \\n "

             'the fatal injury. Flags were also lowered at the iconic '
             'Melbourne Cricket Ground.  **Australian Prime Minister Tony '
             'Abbott** paid tribute to Hughes, describing him as "a young man '
             'living out his dreams".  "His death is a very sad day for '
             'cricket and a heartbreaking day for his family. What happened '
             'has touched millions of Australians," he said.  "For a young '
             'life to be cut short playing our national game seems a shocking '
             'aberration. He was loved, admired and respected by his '

             'with Hughes when the Australian played for Middlesex in 2009.  '
             '"He was a cheeky, funny, positive guy. Looking back, I feel like '

             'England team** also released a statement on Twitter, writing: '
             '"Our deepest sympathies go out to Phil Hughes\\\' family, '
             'friends and team-mates at this incredibly sad time.  "Phil was '
             'admired and respected by all he played with and against and will '
             'never be forgotten by the cricket community."  Giles Clarke, the '
             'England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, said Hughes was "an '
             'extremely popular and hugely respected cricketer in England and '
             'Wales" and "will be missed throughout the world of cricket".  '
             'Former England star **Kevin Pietersen** said Hughes was "growing '
             'and maturing into a magnificent cricketer".  "He was on course '
             'to do some really great things for Australia," he said. "He had '
             'a brilliant start to his career, it\\\'s just such a sad loss."  '
             'Indian icon **Sachin Tendulkar,** who played alongside Hughes in '

             'Sad day for cricket. Deepest condolences to family, friends and '

             'issued a statement offered its "deepest condolences to the '
             'family and friends" of Hughes.  ICC chairman Mr Narayanaswami '
             'Srinivasan added: "We are all shocked and saddened with the news '

             'consoling each other at St Vincent\\\'s Hospital  "On behalf of '
             'the entire cricket community, I would like to extend my sincere '
             'condolences to his family and friends."  Hughes, who had played '
             '26 Tests, **made his Test debut at the age of 20** against South '
             'Africa in 2009.  In only his second match, he became **the '
             'youngest batsman to post two centuries in a single Test.**   '
             '**He played county cricket for Hampshire, Middlesex and '
             'Worcestershire** and shared in what was at the time a world '
             'record 10th-wicket partnership of 163 with Ashton Agar against '
             'England in the 2013 Ashes series.  He has been tipped for a '
             'recall ahead of the upcoming series against India, which is due '
             'to start next week.  Cricket Australia had already decided to '
             'abandon the latest round of Sheffield Shield matches following '
             'the injury to Hughes.  After his death was announced, **cricket '
             'officials from Pakistan and New Zealand chose to postpone the '
             "second day\\'s play** in the third and final Test between the "
             'two countries.  "It\\\'s a sad day for cricket," Pakistan '
             'Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan said in a statement.  New '
             'Zealand Cricket chief executive David White added: "Cricket is a '
             'family. Quite apart from its super-competitive edge, it is a '
             'game of kinship, mateship and friendship; of camaraderie and '
             'community."   **A two-day tour match between a Cricket Australia '
             'XI and India,** scheduled to be played in Adelaide on Friday and '
             'Saturday, **has been cancelled.**  In English cricket, '
             "**Thursday\\'s planned release of the 2015 county championship "
             'fixtures has also been postponed.**  The death of Hughes has '
             'inevitably sparked **further discussion about player safety in '
             'cricket** and the use of helmets.  "It\\\'s an incredibly safe '
             'game, but I think this will shake batsmen slightly out of what '
             'might have been complacency," said former England captain and '
             'opening batsman Michael Atherton.  "I wore the same helmet for '
             "10 years. I never changed it. I didn\\'t give it much thought "
             'really. If there is that kind of complacency that I was guilty '
             'of, then I think people will be shaken out of that."  Former '
             'England captain Mike Gatting believes everything possible is '
             'being done **to make helmets safe.**  Gatting, who had his nose '
             'shattered by a Malcolm Marshall delivery in the West Indies in '
             '1986, described the incident involving Hughes as "just a '
             'one-off, a freak accident".  \\n An emergency helicopter landed '
             'on the cricket ground as Phillip Hughes was being treated  \\n',

             'the third whitewash in Ashes history, and is arguably the worst '
             'tour England have ever undertaken, after they came into this '
             'series as favourites and against a side beaten in seven of their '
             'previous nine Tests.  England won the toss here at the SCG but '
             'ended up humiliated once again, a team unrecognisable in '

             'suffering an identical hiding.  Not in a single Test have they '
