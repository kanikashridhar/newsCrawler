             'Intermittent fasting is becoming an increasingly popular way to '
             "lose weight. What\\'s its appeal and is it safe to fast?  "
             "Whether it\\'s eating in a 5:2 or 16:8 pattern, losing weight is "
             'as much about when you eat as about what you eat these days.  '
             'Recently, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey hit the headlines when he '
             'claimed to eat just one meal a day. Social media was abuzz, with '
             'many critics calling it an extreme diet. But perhaps he was just '
             'following the latest trend.  According to a survey by the '
             'International Food Information Council Foundation intermittent '
             "fasting (IF) was last year\\'s most popular diet.  Intermittent "
             'fasting can take many different forms but it always involves '
             'periods of time where you are taking in very little food, at '
             'regular intervals.  ## Fasting patterns  \\n    * The 16:8 diet '
             'involves fasting for 16 hours per day and eating within an '
             'eight-hour window. This is usually done by only eating from '
             'midday till 8pm. \\n    * The 5:2 diet involves eating only 25% '
             'of a normal calorie intake on two non-consecutive days per '
             'week.  \\n    * A 24 hours fast involves consuming no calories '
             'on one day of the week or month.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'caption\\n \\n Restricting calories usually helps in weight '
             "loss\\n \\n \\n \\n  Fans of intermittent fasting claim it\\'s a "
             'good way to lose weight, and a summary of studies into the '
             'method, published in the Annual Review of Nutrition in 2017, '
             'found that 11 out of 16 trials reported some weight loss.  '
             "\\'\\'The reason for that is simple mathematics, as you are "
             "restricting calories,\\'\\' says Dr Linia Patel, a registered "
             'dietician and spokeswoman for the British Dietician '
             'Association.  However, the study found that some patterns of '
             'fasting were not advisable: alternate-day fasting led to intense '
             'hunger and was therefore considered impractical.  ## Enforced '
             'fasting periods  Fasting has been practised throughout history '
             'for religious, cultural and spiritual reasons, but as a way of '
             'eating it goes back much further.  Dr Patel explains that if we '
             'look at our ancestors, they had periods of enforced fasting. '
             'Hunter-gatherers only had food when they killed or collected it, '
             'so fasting was part of their everyday reality.  But nowadays we '
             'are constantly exposed to plentiful foods. We also lead far less '
             'active lives. Together, these factors have caused an obesity '
             "epidemic.  ## \\'People love rules\\'  Simply telling people to "
             "eat a healthy, balanced diet doesn\\'t seem to work, according "
             'to Dr Patel.  "People love rules," she says. "I think bringing '
             'in a little discipline and having periods where we are not '
             'eating is a positive thing."  Unlike most diets, IF doesn\\\'t '
             'exclude specific food groups, such as fat, sugars or '
             'carbohydrates. All you need is a clock. Perhaps that is part of '
             'its appeal.  For Shanae Dennis, a 26-year-old journalist, it was '
             'the simplicity that appealed.  "I started intermittent fasting '
             'because I really wanted a quick, simple and easy diet. Being '
             'told to just eat between 12 and 8pm was really easy to follow so '
             'I was interested."  "In the beginning I thought I could really '
             'eat whatever I want, but soon I realised that for it to work I '
             'had to eat healthily," says Shanae.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'caption\\n \\n Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables to get enough '
             'dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals.\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## '
             "\\'Feast and famine\\'  This is a common misconception, says Dr "
             'Patel.  "In my clinical practice I find that a lot of people are '
             'not doing intermittent fasting properly," she says. "For example '
             'they might keep the calories below 500 on fasting days but then '
             "they go and feast on the other days.  \\'\\'That\\'s dangerous "
             'from two points of view: you are not going to get the calorie '
             'deficit and lose weight. You need to eat sensibly."  So it\\\'s '
             "not a feast and famine thing. That\\'s not going to work.  In "
             'order for it to be a safe, effective and healthy way of eating, '
             'the food consumed during "eating windows" needs to be of high '
             'nutritional value.  Scientists emphasise that those on IF diets '
             'should include essential fats from oily fish, nuts and seeds, '
             'lean sources of protein, whole-grains and starchy carbohydrates '
             'and plenty of fruit and vegetables to supply enough dietary '
             'fibre, vitamins and minerals.  ## Can you keep it up?  '
             'Calorie-controlled diets all have a similar impact on weight '
             'loss, but the diet that is really successful is one that people '
             'can sustain in the long- term.  One of the difficulties with '
             'sticking to a diet is craving forbidden foods, and with IF that '
             'is perhaps less of a problem.  "When I am on a no-carbohydrate '
             'or low carbohydrate diet all I see is pasta and rice everywhere, '
             "but now I don\\'t crave certain food groups because nothing is "
             'restricted," says Shanae.  She has been following the 16:8 diet '
             'for four months now and finds it easier to keep up than the 5:2 '
             'diet, during which she gets very hungry.  "The hardest thing is '
             'to not reach for the breakfast muffin," says Shanae.  \\n \\n '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Imahn likes the discipline that '
             'comes with intermittent fasting\\n \\n \\n \\n  Imahn Robertson, '
             '26, has been following an IF diet for over four years.  "When I '
             'first started I did struggle, the body naturally craves foods at '
             'all times. But after I got into a routine it was okay," says '
             'Imahn.  "There is temptation, don\\\'t get me wrong. If I am '
             'tempted I will occasionally break my fast and adjust my fasting '
             'period the next day."  However, Imahn admits that her diet has '
             'affected her social life.  "I only eat between 12 and 8pm - if '
             "someone schedules a dinner for nine o\\'clock, I will go to the "
             'dinner but just drink water.  "What makes it difficult is that '
             'people are very judgemental," she says. "I find it easier to do '
             'intermittent fasting when I am single, not when I am in a '
             'relationship."  ## Sugar rush  Freelance cameraman Colum '
             "O\\'Dwyer, 27, has been practising IF for a couple of years now. "
             'He eats two large meals a day, between 12 and 8pm.  "I like the '
             'discipline that comes with it," says Colum. "It gives me a '
             'structure which is sorely needed when you manage your own time.  '
             '"I feel I\\\'m always at risk of procrastinating by having '
             'overly elaborate breakfasts or lunches, so going from three '
             'meals a day to two frees up time and allows for greater '
             'productivity."  For Colum it\\\'s also important to minimise '
             'sugar, to avoid a sugar rush - and subsequent crash.  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Certain foods can have an impact on '
             'insulin levels\\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Patel says that mood swings - '
             'caused by a change in insulin levels - can be a consequence of '
             'fasting, depending on what you are used to eating.  "If you have '
             'a diet that is very high in refined carbohydrates and you snack '
             'a lot, of course fasting is going to mean that you will be '
             'irritable," says Dr Patel.  ## \\\'Not for everyone\\\'  IF can '
             'be unsuitable for people with certain health conditions.  People '
             'with advanced diabetes, history of eating disorders such as '
             'anorexia and bulimia, those suffering from chronic diseases and '
             'pregnant or breastfeeding women should not attempt intermittent '
             'fasting. Fasting should not be attempted unless they are under '
             'the close supervision of a physician.  People who have stomach '
             'ulcers, should not fast either.  This kind of dieting has gained '
             'popularity in the last 10 years or so, but it has not been '
             "around for long enough to prove that it\\'s any better or worse "
             'than other diets, says Dr Patel.  "We don\\\'t have massive '
             "trials but the evidence in this area is increasing. It\\'s not "
             'black and white yet but what we are seeing from the existing '
             'human studies that we have is that there are positive attributes '
             'when done properly."  \\n',

             "\\'\\'The reason for that is simple mathematics, as you are "
             "restricting calories,\\'\\' says Dr Linia Patel, a registered "
             'dietician and spokeswoman for the British Dietician '
             'Association.  However, the study found that some patterns of '
             'fasting were not advisable: alternate-day fasting led to intense '
             'hunger and was therefore considered impractical.  ## Enforced '
             'fasting periods  Fasting has been practised throughout history '
             'for religious, cultural and spiritual reasons, but as a way of '
             'eating it goes back much further.  Dr Patel explains that if we '
             'look at our ancestors, they had periods of enforced fasting. '
             'Hunter-gatherers only had food when they killed or collected it, '
             'so fasting was part of their everyday reality.  But nowadays we '
             'are constantly exposed to plentiful foods. We also lead far less '
             'active lives. Together, these factors have caused an obesity '
             "epidemic.  ## \\'People love rules\\'  Simply telling people to "
             "eat a healthy, balanced diet doesn\\'t seem to work, according "
             'to Dr Patel.  "People love rules," she says. "I think bringing '
             'in a little discipline and having periods where we are not '
             'eating is a positive thing."  Unlike most diets, IF doesn\\\'t '
             'exclude specific food groups, such as fat, sugars or '
             'carbohydrates. All you need is a clock. Perhaps that is part of '
             'its appeal.  For Shanae Dennis, a 26-year-old journalist, it was '
             'the simplicity that appealed.  "I started intermittent fasting '
             'because I really wanted a quick, simple and easy diet. Being '
             'told to just eat between 12 and 8pm was really easy to follow so '
             'I was interested."  "In the beginning I thought I could really '
             'eat whatever I want, but soon I realised that for it to work I '
             'had to eat healthily," says Shanae.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '

             'caption\\n \\n Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables to get enough '
             'dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals.\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## '
             "\\'Feast and famine\\'  This is a common misconception, says Dr "
             'Patel.  "In my clinical practice I find that a lot of people are '
             'not doing intermittent fasting properly," she says. "For example '
             'they might keep the calories below 500 on fasting days but then '
             "they go and feast on the other days.  \\'\\'That\\'s dangerous "
             'from two points of view: you are not going to get the calorie '
             'deficit and lose weight. You need to eat sensibly."  So it\\\'s '
             "not a feast and famine thing. That\\'s not going to work.  In "
             'order for it to be a safe, effective and healthy way of eating, '
             'the food consumed during "eating windows" needs to be of high '
             'nutritional value.  Scientists emphasise that those on IF diets '
             'should include essential fats from oily fish, nuts and seeds, '
             'lean sources of protein, whole-grains and starchy carbohydrates '
             'and plenty of fruit and vegetables to supply enough dietary '
             'fibre, vitamins and minerals.  ## Can you keep it up?  '
             'Calorie-controlled diets all have a similar impact on weight '
             'loss, but the diet that is really successful is one that people '
             'can sustain in the long- term.  One of the difficulties with '
             'sticking to a diet is craving forbidden foods, and with IF that '
             'is perhaps less of a problem.  "When I am on a no-carbohydrate '
             'or low carbohydrate diet all I see is pasta and rice everywhere, '
             "but now I don\\'t crave certain food groups because nothing is "
             'restricted," says Shanae.  She has been following the 16:8 diet '
             'for four months now and finds it easier to keep up than the 5:2 '
             'diet, during which she gets very hungry.  "The hardest thing is '
             'to not reach for the breakfast muffin," says Shanae.  \\n \\n '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Imahn likes the discipline that '
             'comes with intermittent fasting\\n \\n \\n \\n  Imahn Robertson, '
             '26, has been following an IF diet for over four years.  "When I '
             'first started I did struggle, the body naturally craves foods at '
             'all times. But after I got into a routine it was okay," says '
             'Imahn.  "There is temptation, don\\\'t get me wrong. If I am '
             'tempted I will occasionally break my fast and adjust my fasting '
             'period the next day."  However, Imahn admits that her diet has '
             'affected her social life.  "I only eat between 12 and 8pm - if '
             "someone schedules a dinner for nine o\\'clock, I will go to the "
             'dinner but just drink water.  "What makes it difficult is that '
             'people are very judgemental," she says. "I find it easier to do '
             'intermittent fasting when I am single, not when I am in a '
             'relationship."  ## Sugar rush  Freelance cameraman Colum '
             "O\\'Dwyer, 27, has been practising IF for a couple of years now. "
             'He eats two large meals a day, between 12 and 8pm.  "I like the '
             'discipline that comes with it," says Colum. "It gives me a '
             'structure which is sorely needed when you manage your own time.  '
             '"I feel I\\\'m always at risk of procrastinating by having '
             'overly elaborate breakfasts or lunches, so going from three '
             'meals a day to two frees up time and allows for greater '
             'productivity."  For Colum it\\\'s also important to minimise '
             'sugar, to avoid a sugar rush - and subsequent crash.  \\n \\n '

             '\\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Certain foods can have an impact on '
             'insulin levels\\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Patel says that mood swings - '
             'caused by a change in insulin levels - can be a consequence of '
             'fasting, depending on what you are used to eating.  "If you have '
             'a diet that is very high in refined carbohydrates and you snack '
             'a lot, of course fasting is going to mean that you will be '
             'irritable," says Dr Patel.  ## \\\'Not for everyone\\\'  IF can '
             'be unsuitable for people with certain health conditions.  People '
             'with advanced diabetes, history of eating disorders such as '
             'anorexia and bulimia, those suffering from chronic diseases and '
             'pregnant or breastfeeding women should not attempt intermittent '
             'fasting. Fasting should not be attempted unless they are under '
             'the close supervision of a physician.  People who have stomach '
             'ulcers, should not fast either.  This kind of dieting has gained '
             'popularity in the last 10 years or so, but it has not been '
             "around for long enough to prove that it\\'s any better or worse "
             'than other diets, says Dr Patel.  "We don\\\'t have massive '
             "trials but the evidence in this area is increasing. It\\'s not "
             'black and white yet but what we are seeing from the existing '
             'human studies that we have is that there are positive attributes '
             'when done properly."  \\n',

             '5% increase on the 422,147 in 2017.  Gonorrhoea increased the '
             'most - by 26% to 56,259 cases, the largest number since 1978.  '
             'There were 7,541 cases of syphilis - a 5% increase on 2017.  '
             'High-risk groups include young people and men who have sex with '
             'men.  The most commonly diagnosed STIs were:  \\n    * chlamydia '
             '(218,095 cases, 49% of all new STI diagnoses)  \\n    * genital '
             'warts (57,318 cases, 13%) \\n    * gonorrhoea (56,259 cases, '
             '13%) \\n    * genital herpes (33,867 cases, 8%) \\n  The number '
             'of gonorrhoea cases has been increasing for years among both men '
             'and women, despite repeated warnings from public health doctors '
             'about the risks of unprotected sex.  Sometimes referred to as '

             'pass it on to their sexual partner.  It can be treated with '
             'antibiotics, although there have been recent reports of some '
             'cases of hard-to-treat "super-gonorrhoea" that are resistant to '
             'the usual choice of drugs.  People with any of the symptoms of '
             'gonorrhoea - a yellow or green discharge from the vagina or '
             'penis, or pain urinating - should visit their GP or a sexual '
             'health clinic for a test.  Gonorrhoea can cause serious '
             'long-term health problems, including infertility in women.  '
             'Experts are worried that many people are not getting tested for '

             'are also a concern.  Dr Gwenda Hughes, from Public Health '
             'England, said: "The rise in sexually transmitted infections is '
             'concerning.  "No matter what age you are, or what type of '
             "relationship you are in, it\\'s important to look after your "
             'sexual health. If you have sex with a new or casual partner, '
             'make sure you use condoms and get regularly tested."  Dr Olwen '
             'Williams, president of British Association for Sexual Health and '
             'HIV, said sexual health services were at breaking point.  '
             '"Recent years have unfortunately seen severe and damaging cuts '
             'to sexual health service funding, jeopardising our ability to '
             'meet these challenges at a critical time," she said.  "The '
             'continuing escalation in gonorrhoea and syphilis diagnoses must '

             'the potential for devastating consequences to the wellbeing of '
             'the wider population and the health system as a whole."  '
             'Screening for chlamydia continued to decline in 2018, with just '
             'over 1.3 million young people tested.  Meanwhile, new cases of '
             'genital warts continued to decline.  Experts say this is due to '

             'collapsed by 99% within 45 days.  The researchers say their aim '
             'is not to make the insects extinct but to help stop the spread '
             'of malaria.  The disease, which is spread when female mosquitoes '
             'drink blood, kills more than 400,000 people per year.  '
             'Worldwide, there are about 219 million cases of malaria each '
             'year.  Conducting the study, researchers at the University of '
             'Maryland in the US - and the IRSS research institute in Burkina '

             'real-world conditions as possible.  A 6,500-sq-ft fake village - '
             'complete with plants, huts, water sources and food for the '
             'mosquitoes - was set up in Burkina Faso. It was surrounded by a '

             'prospects for controlling mosquitoes using this modified fungus '
             'are high.  "Proportionate bio-safety regulations are needed to '
             'ensure that the viability of this and other approaches for '
             'vector [mosquito] control using genetic methods are not lost '
             'through overly zealous restrictions."  Dr Tony Nolan, from the '
             'Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, added: "These results are '
             'encouraging.  "We need new and complementary tools to augment '

             'prospects for controlling mosquitoes using this modified fungus '
             'are high.  "Proportionate bio-safety regulations are needed to '
             'ensure that the viability of this and other approaches for '
             'vector [mosquito] control using genetic methods are not lost '
             'through overly zealous restrictions."  Dr Tony Nolan, from the '
             'Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, added: "These results are '
             'encouraging.  "We need new and complementary tools to augment '
             'existing control methods, which are being affected by the '
             'development of insecticide-resistance."   _Follow James_on '

             'give people resistance to HIV.  So, Prof He made embryos in an '

             'alter the CCR5 gene.  The resulting girls - known as Lulu and '

             'life expectancy?  The problem is CCR5 has a bigger role in the '
             'body than just making people vulnerable to HIV.  It is active in '
             'the brain and in fighting off other infections, particularly '
             'flu.  The study, at the University of California, Berkeley, '
             'looked at nearly 410,000 people in the UK.  It showed those who '
             'had only the mutated version of CCR5 were 20% more likely to die '
             'before they turned 78.  "In this case, it is probably not a '
             'mutation that most people would want to have," said Prof Rasmus '
             'Nielsen, from UC Berkeley.  "You are actually, on average, worse '
             'off having it."  Fellow researcher Dr Xinzhu Wei said the '
             'gene-editing technology, known as Crispr, was still too risky to '
             'be using on children.  "The Crispr technology is far too '

             'Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, from the Francis Crick Institute.  Not '
             'everyone who carried the mutations in the study died young but '
             'it was more likely.  And life expectancy depends on a complex '
             'mix of the DNA you are born with and the world you live in.  To '
             'further complicate things, Prof He mutated CCR5 in a similar '
             'rather than identical way to people who have HIV resistance.  '
             'Prof Lovell-Badge said the study "shows once more that He '
             'Jiankui was foolish to choose CCR5 to mutate".  ## What was the '
             'reaction to Prof He doing this?  There was universal '
             'condemnation by scientists when Prof He made the announcement in '
             'November.  Some described the experiment as "monstrous".  And he '
             'was criticised for experimenting when the risks to otherwise '
             'healthy children were unclear and for acting against Chinese '
             'law.  There was also anger because HIV can be treated and there '
             'was barely any risk of it being passed from the HIV-positive '
             'father to his children.  The Chinese authorities investigated '
             'and concluded that Prof He had acted illegally in pursuit of '
             '"fame and fortune".  Prof He has always defended his experiments '
             'and at a summit in Hong Kong said he was "proud" of his '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  The '
             'ultimate limit of human endurance has been worked out by '
             'scientists analysing a 3,000 mile run, the Tour de France and '
             'other elite events.  They showed the cap was 2.5 times the '
             "body\\'s resting metabolic rate, or 4,000 calories a day for an "
             'average person.  Anything higher than that was not sustainable '
             'in the long term.  The research, by Duke University, also showed '
             'pregnant women were endurance specialists, living at nearly the '
             'limit of what the human body can cope with.  The study started '
             'with the Race Across the USA in which athletes ran 3,080 miles '
             'from California to Washington DC in 140 days.  Competitors were '
             'running six marathons a week for months, and scientists were '
             'investigating the effect on their bodies.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'Image caption\\n \\n A Race Across the USA runner has his '
             'resting energy expenditure measured\\n \\n \\n \\n  Resting '
             'metabolic rate - the calories the body burns through when it is '
             'relaxing - was recorded before and during the race.  And '
             'calories burned in the extreme endurance event were recorded.  '
             'The study, in Science Advances, showed energy use started off '
             'high but eventually levelled off at 2.5 times the resting '
             'metabolic rate.  The study found a pattern between the length of '
             'a sporting event and energy expenditure; and that while running '
             'a marathon may be beyond many, it is nowhere near the limit of '
             'human endurance.  \\n    * Marathon (just the one) runners used '
             '15.6 times their resting metabolic rate \\n    * Cyclists during '
             'the 23 days of the Tour de France used 4.9 times their resting '
             'metabolic rate \\n    * A 95-day Antarctic trekker used 3.5 '
             'times the resting metabolic rate \\n  "You can do really intense '
             'stuff for a couple of days, but if you want to last longer then '
             'you have to dial it back," Dr Herman Pontzer, from Duke '
             'University, told BBC News.  He added: "Every data point, for '
             'every event, is all mapped onto this beautifully crisp barrier '
             'of human endurance.  "Nobody we know of has ever pushed through '
             'it."  During pregnancy, women\\\'s energy use peaks at 2.2 times '
             'their resting metabolic rate, the study showed.  \\n \\n \\n '

             'the USA in 2015.\\n \\n \\n \\n  The researchers argue the 2.5 '
             'figure may be down to the human digestive system, rather than '
             'anything to do with the heart, lungs or muscles.  They found the '
             'body cannot digest, absorb and process enough calories and '
             'nutrients to sustain a higher level of energy use.  The body can '
             'use up its own resources burning through fat or muscle mass - '
             'which can be recovered afterwards - in shorter events.  But in '
             'extreme events - at the limits of human exhaustion - the body '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  The '
             'ultimate limit of human endurance has been worked out by '
             'scientists analysing a 3,000 mile run, the Tour de France and '
             'other elite events.  They showed the cap was 2.5 times the '
             "body\\'s resting metabolic rate, or 4,000 calories a day for an "
             'average person.  Anything higher than that was not sustainable '
             'in the long term.  The research, by Duke University, also showed '
             'pregnant women were endurance specialists, living at nearly the '
             'limit of what the human body can cope with.  The study started '
             'with the Race Across the USA in which athletes ran 3,080 miles '
             'from California to Washington DC in 140 days.  Competitors were '
             'running six marathons a week for months, and scientists were '
             'investigating the effect on their bodies.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '
             '\\n \\n Image copyright\\n Bryce Carlson\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             'Image caption\\n \\n A Race Across the USA runner has his '
             'resting energy expenditure measured\\n \\n \\n \\n  Resting '
             'metabolic rate - the calories the body burns through when it is '
             'relaxing - was recorded before and during the race.  And '
             'calories burned in the extreme endurance event were recorded.  '
             'The study, in Science Advances, showed energy use started off '
             'high but eventually levelled off at 2.5 times the resting '
             'metabolic rate.  The study found a pattern between the length of '
             'a sporting event and energy expenditure; and that while running '
             'a marathon may be beyond many, it is nowhere near the limit of '
             'human endurance.  \\n    * Marathon (just the one) runners used '
             '15.6 times their resting metabolic rate \\n    * Cyclists during '
             'the 23 days of the Tour de France used 4.9 times their resting '
             'metabolic rate \\n    * A 95-day Antarctic trekker used 3.5 '
             'times the resting metabolic rate \\n  "You can do really intense '
             'stuff for a couple of days, but if you want to last longer then '
             'you have to dial it back," Dr Herman Pontzer, from Duke '
             'University, told BBC News.  He added: "Every data point, for '
             'every event, is all mapped onto this beautifully crisp barrier '
             'of human endurance.  "Nobody we know of has ever pushed through '
             'it."  During pregnancy, women\\\'s energy use peaks at 2.2 times '
             'their resting metabolic rate, the study showed.  \\n \\n \\n '

             'the USA in 2015.\\n \\n \\n \\n  The researchers argue the 2.5 '
             'figure may be down to the human digestive system, rather than '
             'anything to do with the heart, lungs or muscles.  They found the '
             'body cannot digest, absorb and process enough calories and '
             'nutrients to sustain a higher level of energy use.  The body can '
             'use up its own resources burning through fat or muscle mass - '
             'which can be recovered afterwards - in shorter events.  But in '
             'extreme events - at the limits of human exhaustion - the body '
             'has to balance its energy use, the researchers argue.  Dr '

             'diagnosed or managed."  She said constipation was usually caused '

             'sign of another underlying problem, such as bowel cancer, '

             'Glucosamine supplements, better known as a remedy for joint '
             "pain, may lower a person\\'s risk of cardiovascular disease "
             '(CVD), research suggests.  The findings in the British Medical '
             'Journal (BMJ) come from nearly half a million people in the UK.  '
             'Almost one in five of the 466,039 participants said they took '
             'glucosamine.  Users were less likely to develop heart and artery '
             'diseases or stroke, or die from these conditions.  The results '
             'suggest a possible benefit, but more and longer studies are '
             'needed.  It could be that users are generally more healthy, '
             'rather than glucosamine having a direct effect, experts '
             'caution.  ## What is glucosamine?  Glucosamine is a naturally '
             'occurring compound found in joint cartilage.  The body can make '
             'its own glucosamine, but supplements are sometimes used by '
             'people looking to relieve pain and symptoms of osteoarthritis '
             'and other joint disorders.  Most glucosamine supplements are '
             'sold in pharmacies and health food shops in the UK as a "food '
             'supplement" and not a medicine. They are checked for food safety '
             "to ensure they won\\'t do you any harm, but they are not checked "
             'for quality or quantity of the "active" ingredient.  The active '
             'ingredient can be made synthetically or derived from the shells '
             'of shellfish.  ## Does it work?  The evidence supporting the '
             'effectiveness of glucosamine for joint pain is mixed and very '
             'limited. Guidelines for the NHS do not recommend it for '
             'osteoarthritis.  The new suggested link to a lower risk of '
             'cardiovascular disease needs more research. The BMJ study was '
             "observational - it can\\'t establish cause. And it did not "
             'include detailed information on glucosamine dose or duration of '
             'use.  Glucosamine was associated with a 9%-22% lower risk of CVD '
             'death, coronary heart disease and stroke, compared to non-use '
             'over the 10 years of the study.  The researchers believe the '
             'supplement may have an anti-inflammatory effect, which could '
             'explain the suggested benefit, but more investigations are '
             'needed.  ## Is it safe?  Studies on the safety of glucosamine '
             'are limited.  People with an allergy to shellfish should not '
             'take it, nor should women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  '
             'Glucosamine should be avoided by people taking warfarin, as it '
             'may affect blood clotting.  It may also decrease the '
             'effectiveness of some anti-cancer drugs, say experts.  Like any '
             'supplement or medication, it can cause side-effects in some '
             'individuals.  ## What do experts think of the findings?  Prof '
             'Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: "Only a '
             'trial can determine whether there is any truth to the lower '
             'observed risk. Observational studies can only ever generate new '
             'ideas to test.  "Many other supplements have not proven benefits '
             'in trials even when observational data suggested there may be '
             'health benefits. Some supplements have even been shown to cause '
             'harm in trials. So, for now, I would not rush to buy glucosamine '
             'to lessen my heart risks when there are many other cost- '
             'effective proven ways to do so."  Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, from '
             'the British Heart Foundation, said: "One in four people in the '
             'UK still die from heart and circulatory disease. We urgently '
             'need to fund research that could result in improved prevention, '
             'diagnosis and treatment.  "If a well-known and widely available '
             'supplement like glucosamine could help prevent heart and '
             'circulatory diseases, including heart attack and stroke, it is '
             'an avenue of research worth exploring.  "Meanwhile, an important '
             'way to reduce your risk is to maintain a healthy lifestyle and - '
             'when relevant - take medications as recommended to you by your '
             'doctor."  \\n',

             'Syphilis might be more commonly associated with centuries past. '
             "But it\\'s been on the rise for the past decade in England, with "
             'more cases last year than in any year since 1949.  The disease '
             'was, in effect, eradicated in the UK in the mid-80s only to re- '
             'emerge around 1999.  BBC Reality Check wanted to know why this '
             'ancient disease is rearing its head in England in the 21st '
             'Century.  Syphilis is a bacterial infection that can be treated '
             'with antibiotics. Its symptoms include:  \\n    * sores around '
             'the genitals and mouth \\n    * a rash on the hands and feet  '
             '\\n    * tiredness \\n    * headaches and joint pain \\n    * a '
             'high temperature  \\n  Left untreated over many years, it can '
             'spread to the brain, and be fatal.  Syphilis is still relatively '
             'uncommon, making up fewer than 2% of all sexually transmitted '
             'infections (STIs) diagnosed in England 2017.  The fact that '
             "we\\'re dealing with a small overall number of cases makes the "
             'percentage increase look more dramatic - 1,000 extra cases in '
             '2017 equated to a 20% rise. The same number of extra cases of '
             'chlamydia would represent less than a 1% rise.  But '
             'nevertheless, there has been a steady rise with the number of '
             'diagnosed cases more than doubling in a decade - 7,137 last year '
             'up from 2,874 in 2008.  The increase in syphilis was almost all '
             'among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, '
             'according to government agency Public Health England, accounting '
             'for 78% of all cases diagnosed last year.  Public Health England '
             'said it plans "to increase numbers and frequency of tests in '
             'populations at higher risk of infection, to promote early '
             'detection and treatment".  ## \\\'Chemsex\\\' trend  British '
             'Association for Sexual Health and HIV spokesman, Dr Patrick '
             'French, says increases in STIs are usually linked to changes in '
             'sexual behaviour in a population.  He says this recent rise in '
             'cases of syphilis has been driven in part by behaviour changes '
             'particularly among men who have sex with men.  Apps like Grindr '
             'have made casual sex more available and have been linked to a '
             'rise in people having group sex, which seems to be a risk factor '
             'for contracting syphilis, Dr French says.  And there is a '
             'growing "chemsex" trend - where people take drugs like crystal '
             'meth during sex, potentially reducing their inhibitions and '
             'making them less likely to use protection.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'around the world\\n \\n \\n \\n  Public health consultant for '
             'the NHS in south London, Dr Gillian Holdsworth, agrees that '
             '"dating apps may well contribute to the access to casual '
             'relationships", and it was a factor pointed to by Public Health '
             'England when it released the statistics.  Although chlamydia - '
             'by far the most common STI - has fallen among the whole '
             'population, it has risen among men who have sex with men, along '
             'with syphilis and gonorrhoea. Cases of each of these three '
             'infections have risen by roughly 20% in a year.  Gonorrhoea has '
             'increased across the population as a whole, however, with a '
             'fifth more cases diagnosed in 2017 than the year before.  ## '
             'More testing  Syphilis and gonorrhoea are both highly contagious '
             'and, unlike some STIs, can be contracted through oral sex.  On '
             'top of changes to sexual behaviour, more people are attending '
             'STI clinics meaning more cases of syphilis are being diagnosed. '
             "So that\\'s likely to explain part of the rise.  And men who "
             "have sex with men are more likely to get tested, so it\\'s "
             'possible there are more people with undiagnosed infections in '
             'the rest of the population.  Sexual health clinic attendances '
             'increased by more than 10% between 2013 and 2016, and by about '
             '30% among men who have sex with men.  But the increase in '
             'infections has outstripped the increase in testing, suggesting '
             "there\\'s been a genuine rise in STIs.  Budget cuts to sexual "
             'health services have also been pointed to as a possible cause.  '

             'Syphilis might be more commonly associated with centuries past. '
             "But it\\'s been on the rise for the past decade in England, with "
             'more cases last year than in any year since 1949.  The disease '
             'was, in effect, eradicated in the UK in the mid-80s only to re- '
             'emerge around 1999.  BBC Reality Check wanted to know why this '
             'ancient disease is rearing its head in England in the 21st '
             'Century.  Syphilis is a bacterial infection that can be treated '
             'with antibiotics. Its symptoms include:  \\n    * sores around '
             'the genitals and mouth \\n    * a rash on the hands and feet  '
             '\\n    * tiredness \\n    * headaches and joint pain \\n    * a '
             'high temperature  \\n  Left untreated over many years, it can '
             'spread to the brain, and be fatal.  Syphilis is still relatively '
             'uncommon, making up fewer than 2% of all sexually transmitted '
             'infections (STIs) diagnosed in England 2017.  The fact that '
             "we\\'re dealing with a small overall number of cases makes the "
             'percentage increase look more dramatic - 1,000 extra cases in '
             '2017 equated to a 20% rise. The same number of extra cases of '
             'chlamydia would represent less than a 1% rise.  But '
             'nevertheless, there has been a steady rise with the number of '
             'diagnosed cases more than doubling in a decade - 7,137 last year '
             'up from 2,874 in 2008.  The increase in syphilis was almost all '
             'among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, '
             'according to government agency Public Health England, accounting '
             'for 78% of all cases diagnosed last year.  Public Health England '
             'said it plans "to increase numbers and frequency of tests in '
             'populations at higher risk of infection, to promote early '
             'detection and treatment".  ## \\\'Chemsex\\\' trend  British '
             'Association for Sexual Health and HIV spokesman, Dr Patrick '
             'French, says increases in STIs are usually linked to changes in '
             'sexual behaviour in a population.  He says this recent rise in '
             'cases of syphilis has been driven in part by behaviour changes '
             'particularly among men who have sex with men.  Apps like Grindr '
             'have made casual sex more available and have been linked to a '
             'rise in people having group sex, which seems to be a risk factor '
             'for contracting syphilis, Dr French says.  And there is a '
             'growing "chemsex" trend - where people take drugs like crystal '
             'meth during sex, potentially reducing their inhibitions and '
             'making them less likely to use protection.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'caption\\n \\n The gay dating app has almost 4 million members '
             'around the world\\n \\n \\n \\n  Public health consultant for '
             'the NHS in south London, Dr Gillian Holdsworth, agrees that '
             '"dating apps may well contribute to the access to casual '
             'relationships", and it was a factor pointed to by Public Health '
             'England when it released the statistics.  Although chlamydia - '
             'by far the most common STI - has fallen among the whole '
             'population, it has risen among men who have sex with men, along '
             'with syphilis and gonorrhoea. Cases of each of these three '
             'infections have risen by roughly 20% in a year.  Gonorrhoea has '
             'increased across the population as a whole, however, with a '
             'fifth more cases diagnosed in 2017 than the year before.  ## '
             'More testing  Syphilis and gonorrhoea are both highly contagious '
             'and, unlike some STIs, can be contracted through oral sex.  On '
             'top of changes to sexual behaviour, more people are attending '
             'STI clinics meaning more cases of syphilis are being diagnosed. '
             "So that\\'s likely to explain part of the rise.  And men who "
             "have sex with men are more likely to get tested, so it\\'s "
             'possible there are more people with undiagnosed infections in '
             'the rest of the population.  Sexual health clinic attendances '
             'increased by more than 10% between 2013 and 2016, and by about '
             '30% among men who have sex with men.  But the increase in '
             'infections has outstripped the increase in testing, suggesting '
             "there\\'s been a genuine rise in STIs.  Budget cuts to sexual "
             'health services have also been pointed to as a possible cause.  '

             "Caroline\\'s greatest fear was that her son Jack would have no "
             'control over his bowels when he started school.  When he was '
             'about 18 months old, he was diagnosed with toddler diarrhoea, '
             'put on a low-fibre diet and his mum Caroline was told he would '
             'grow out of the problem.  But the diarrhoea continued and so did '
             'the accidents.  "He would go to nursery with a bag of spare '
             'clothes because he had two or three accidents a day," Caroline '
             'says.  "As he got older he started to realise that wasn\\\'t '
             'normal."  With no sign of any improvement after almost two '
             'years, Caroline sought a second opinion and Jack was diagnosed '
             'with chronic constipation. The diarrhoea had just been a symptom '
             'of a more serious underlying problem.  Finally, with advice from '
             "children\\'s continence charity ERIC, Jack was put on a course "
             'of medication which helped to clear the contents of his bowel '
             'and then a dose which would help to keep his system moving in '
             'the future.  Within two or three months, his mum says, he was '
             '"all clear", just in time for starting primary school in '
             'Wiltshire, but they had been dealing with a misdiagnosis for '
             'nearly two years.  One particular incident brought it home to '
             "Caroline just how awful Jack\\'s problem had become and how "
             'traumatic it felt for him.  "He\\\'d locked himself in the '
             "toilet with one of his baby brother\\'s nappies and was trying "
             'to put it on..."  Constipation in children is not unusual - '
             "children\\'s continence charity ERIC says between 5% and 30% of "
             'children suffer from it, yet parents complain that the condition '
             'often goes unrecognised.  It says GPs are failing to diagnose '
             'the problem properly and not referring to a specialist when they '
             'should - and sometimes the advice they give is wrong.  Rhia '
             'Weston, from ERIC, says children should be encouraged to drink '
             'more water, prescribed a laxative to clear them out and then put '
             "on a \\'maintenance dose\\'.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image "

             'Children starting primary school can become constipated because '
             'of a new routine\\n \\n \\n \\n  Changing their diets and adding '
             'more fibre may work, but it is not going to solve everything.  '
             '"More often it\\\'s to do with dehydration because the child is '
             'not drinking enough at school and is possibly holding on and not '
             'going to the toilet at school," she says.  "Or it may be caused '
             'by a fever or medication. They can experience one painful poo '
             'and then it becomes a vicious cycle of not wanting to go."  '
             'Although constipation can be caused by physical problems too, '
             'she said it was important to make sure children got a decent '
             'amount of exercise and had a toilet routine in place - for '
             'example, sitting on the toilet 20 minutes after each meal.  Dr '
             'Anton Emmanuel, consultant neuro-gastroenterologist at '
             'University College London, agrees that traditionally the '
             'emphasis has been on increasing fibre intake.  "But that '
             "doesn\\'t work for everyone. If people have tried that and it "
             'doesn\\\'t work, they need to try something else," he says.  One '
             'new therapy - called biofeedback - focuses on re-training the '
             "body\\'s functions to work normally, rather than relying on the "
             'laxative effect of drugs.  Biofeedback uses special sensors '
             'connected to computers to measure bodily functions, even ones we '
             'are not aware of, and this information helps patients find out '
             'how their bodies are actually working.  By retraining the pelvic '
             'floor and sphincter to work the right way, the idea is that '
             'normal bowel control can be re-learnt and restored.  Dr Emmanuel '
             'explains: "Therapies have failed because the pelvic floor is '
             'tightly shut. People avoid loos, they hold on, and so the pelvic '
             'floor doesn\\\'t relax."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n '
             'Chronic constipation can cause stomach cramps and pain\\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  He says that, over three or four biofeedback sessions, '
             'people can see improvements by doing pelvic floor exercises, '
             'among others.  Tammie Cherry, from Kent, has experienced the '
             'positive effects of biofeedback after nearly 30 years of '
             'suffering with chronic constipation, which often led to painful '
             'stomach cramps and terrible episodes of diarrhoea.  She first '
             'noticed the problems around the age of 10 but was told she would '
             'grow out of it if she ate more fibre in her diet - but that '
             "didn\\'t work.  She was eventually referred to St Mark\\'s "
             'Hospital in Harrow and treated at the Biofeedback Unit. After '
             'two months of a tailored diet while following specific stomach '
             'exercises, she had normal bowel movements and some control over '
             'her life again.  "I can go shopping now, sit down on a bus and '
             "go out of the house without being caught short - and I\\'ve got "
             'no chronic pain. It\\\'s fantastic."  Constipation is the second '
             'or third most common reason among potty-trained children for '
             "going to see the GP, but Dr Emmanuel says it\\'s important to "
             'look more deeply.  "Constipation is just a symptom. It can mean '
             'different things in different people. We must understand the '
             "mechanism of the individual because it\\'s not the same for "
             'everyone."  Caroline describes how they had to help Jack retrain '
             'his body how to poo which led to a battle of wills and many, '
             'many tears.  Now that he is five years old, in Reception class, '
             'and in a good toilet routine, he is a very different boy, his '
             'mum explains.  "Physically he is much more content and, because '
             'his body is working better, he is happier."  Looking back, '
             'Caroline knows that with a correct, early diagnosis and some '
             "proper support Jack\\'s early years should have been very "
             'different.  \\n',

             'of a more serious underlying problem.  Finally, with advice from '
             "children\\'s continence charity ERIC, Jack was put on a course "
             'of medication which helped to clear the contents of his bowel '
             'and then a dose which would help to keep his system moving in '
             'the future.  Within two or three months, his mum says, he was '
             '"all clear", just in time for starting primary school in '
             'Wiltshire, but they had been dealing with a misdiagnosis for '
             'nearly two years.  One particular incident brought it home to '
             "Caroline just how awful Jack\\'s problem had become and how "
             'traumatic it felt for him.  "He\\\'d locked himself in the '
             "toilet with one of his baby brother\\'s nappies and was trying "
             'to put it on..."  Constipation in children is not unusual - '
             "children\\'s continence charity ERIC says between 5% and 30% of "
             'children suffer from it, yet parents complain that the condition '
             'often goes unrecognised.  It says GPs are failing to diagnose '
             'the problem properly and not referring to a specialist when they '
             'should - and sometimes the advice they give is wrong.  Rhia '
             'Weston, from ERIC, says children should be encouraged to drink '
             'more water, prescribed a laxative to clear them out and then put '
             "on a \\'maintenance dose\\'.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image "

             'Children starting primary school can become constipated because '
             'of a new routine\\n \\n \\n \\n  Changing their diets and adding '
             'more fibre may work, but it is not going to solve everything.  '
             '"More often it\\\'s to do with dehydration because the child is '
             'not drinking enough at school and is possibly holding on and not '
             'going to the toilet at school," she says.  "Or it may be caused '
             'by a fever or medication. They can experience one painful poo '
             'and then it becomes a vicious cycle of not wanting to go."  '
             'Although constipation can be caused by physical problems too, '
             'she said it was important to make sure children got a decent '
             'amount of exercise and had a toilet routine in place - for '
             'example, sitting on the toilet 20 minutes after each meal.  Dr '
             'Anton Emmanuel, consultant neuro-gastroenterologist at '
             'University College London, agrees that traditionally the '
             'emphasis has been on increasing fibre intake.  "But that '
             "doesn\\'t work for everyone. If people have tried that and it "
             'doesn\\\'t work, they need to try something else," he says.  One '
             'new therapy - called biofeedback - focuses on re-training the '
             "body\\'s functions to work normally, rather than relying on the "
             'laxative effect of drugs.  Biofeedback uses special sensors '
             'connected to computers to measure bodily functions, even ones we '
             'are not aware of, and this information helps patients find out '
             'how their bodies are actually working.  By retraining the pelvic '
             'floor and sphincter to work the right way, the idea is that '
             'normal bowel control can be re-learnt and restored.  Dr Emmanuel '
             'explains: "Therapies have failed because the pelvic floor is '
             'tightly shut. People avoid loos, they hold on, and so the pelvic '
             'floor doesn\\\'t relax."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n '
             'Chronic constipation can cause stomach cramps and pain\\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  He says that, over three or four biofeedback sessions, '
             'people can see improvements by doing pelvic floor exercises, '
             'among others.  Tammie Cherry, from Kent, has experienced the '
             'positive effects of biofeedback after nearly 30 years of '
             'suffering with chronic constipation, which often led to painful '
             'stomach cramps and terrible episodes of diarrhoea.  She first '
             'noticed the problems around the age of 10 but was told she would '
             'grow out of it if she ate more fibre in her diet - but that '
             "didn\\'t work.  She was eventually referred to St Mark\\'s "
             'Hospital in Harrow and treated at the Biofeedback Unit. After '
             'two months of a tailored diet while following specific stomach '
             'exercises, she had normal bowel movements and some control over '
             'her life again.  "I can go shopping now, sit down on a bus and '
             "go out of the house without being caught short - and I\\'ve got "
             'no chronic pain. It\\\'s fantastic."  Constipation is the second '
             'or third most common reason among potty-trained children for '
             "going to see the GP, but Dr Emmanuel says it\\'s important to "
             'look more deeply.  "Constipation is just a symptom. It can mean '
             'different things in different people. We must understand the '
             "mechanism of the individual because it\\'s not the same for "
             'everyone."  Caroline describes how they had to help Jack retrain '
             'his body how to poo which led to a battle of wills and many, '
             'many tears.  Now that he is five years old, in Reception class, '
             'and in a good toilet routine, he is a very different boy, his '
             'mum explains.  "Physically he is much more content and, because '
             'his body is working better, he is happier."  Looking back, '
             'Caroline knows that with a correct, early diagnosis and some '
             "proper support Jack\\'s early years should have been very "
             'different.  \\n',

             'Hospitals across England have been told to cancel non-emergency '
             'operations in the new year to prepare for a post-Christmas surge '
             'in patients.  The first weeks of January are often the busiest '
             'of the year with winter illnesses peaking, combined with the '
             'growing day-to-day demand in A&E.  So an emergency panel of NHS '
             'bosses is urging hospitals to cut back on their routine work, '
             'such as knee and hip ops.  They hope it will give hospitals some '
             'breathing space to cope.  Publicly, no figure is being put on '
             'the number of operations that should be put off, although the '
             'BBC understands hospitals are working on the basis of doing 10% '
             'fewer.  That would mean in the region of 15,000 operations not '
             'taking place in the first two weeks of January.  The panel has '
             'suggested hospitals use the staff freed up by the move to set up '
             '"hot clinics" staffed by experts in conditions such as '
             'respiratory illness to take the pressure off A&E.  The directive '
             'is the first to be issued by the NHS National Emergency '
             'Pressures Panel, a new group of senior doctors, nurses and '
             'managers set up to advise NHS England.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   **If '
             "you can\\'t see the NHS Tracker,**click or tap here **.**  Panel "
             'chair Prof Sir Bruce Keogh said it would be sensible for '
             'hospitals to curtail the amount of planned work they are doing '
             'until at least mid January.  "NHS staff are working flat out to '
             'cope with seasonal pressures and ensure patients receive the '
             'best possible care.  "However, given the scale of the challenge, '
             'hospitals should be planning for a surge that comes in the new '
             'year by freeing up beds and staff where they can to care for our '
             'sickest patients."  He said this would reduce the need for '
             'last-minute cancellations which were unfair on patients.  It '
             'comes as figures released on Thursday showed pressures had '
             'already started building.  The weekly bulletin from NHS England '
             'showed over 1,000 beds were closed because of the vomiting bug '
             'Norovirus - nearly 10% of the hospital bed-stock - while '
             'ambulances were increasingly likely to find themselves delayed '
             'when they dropped off patients at A&E.  Pauline Philip, the NHS '
             'national director for emergency care, said it was a sensible '
             'move.  She also urged hospitals to make the most of the extra '
             '£350m winter funding provided by the government, which was '
             'released into the system last week.  And she added: "There is '
             'still time for the public to play their part by ensuring they '
             'have their flu jab and by using local pharmacies and NHS 111."  '
             'Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, '
             'welcomed the move as it provided clarity over what should be '
             'done as pressures grow.  But he said it was still pretty "short '
             'notice" for those patients who face having their operations '
             'cancelled.  And he urged hospitals to prioritise cancer '
             'treatment and other planned operations that, if cancelled, would '
             'harm patients.  \\n',

             'Brian Vickers from London had an operation for bowel cancer in '
             'March which involved having a stoma (ileostomy bag) fitted. The '

             '"I set an alarm for three in the morning every night to empty '
             'the bag, but still, on a very regular basis, it leaks. This '
             'means a shower, change of clothing whilst my wife changes the '
             'sheets.  "The consultant whilst I was still in hospital informed '
             'me this would be a problem and I would have the reversal '
             'operation once my chemotherapy finished in July.  "I had a long '
             'wait until December and since then my operation for the reversal '
             '- which is not urgent in the medical sense - has been cancelled '
             'twice, along with one provisional date also coming to nothing.  '
             '"One side of me does not want to complain, but I am so annoyed '
             'with the government who are in total denial with the crisis in '
             'the NHS.  "I want my life back, I want reduced power bills, I '

             'notice.  "My son Robert is 20 years old but has a mental age of '
             'a seven or nine-year- old. He has severe special needs, plus '
             'epilepsy and a very rare genetic defect.  "He was due to go in '

             'better, as he is in severe and constant pain. On Wednesday '

             'does not understand why the surgery he has been preparing for '
             'has now been cancelled at the last minute. He is in tears '
             'knowing he will be in pain when he walks.  "A lot of preparation '

             'Brian Vickers from London had an operation for bowel cancer in '
             'March which involved having a stoma (ileostomy bag) fitted. The '
             'stoma retracted and severe leaks have been a constant problem.  '
             '"I set an alarm for three in the morning every night to empty '

             'me this would be a problem and I would have the reversal '
             'operation once my chemotherapy finished in July.  "I had a long '
             'wait until December and since then my operation for the reversal '
             '- which is not urgent in the medical sense - has been cancelled '
             'twice, along with one provisional date also coming to nothing.  '
             '"One side of me does not want to complain, but I am so annoyed '

             'notice.  "My son Robert is 20 years old but has a mental age of '
             'a seven or nine-year- old. He has severe special needs, plus '

             'better, as he is in severe and constant pain. On Wednesday '

             'does not understand why the surgery he has been preparing for '
             'has now been cancelled at the last minute. He is in tears '
             'knowing he will be in pain when he walks.  "A lot of preparation '

 'newsText': '\\n  \\n \\n \\n ![Gut '
             'bacteria](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4D84/production/_100844891_humanbehind16_9.jpg)\\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  "Good bacteria" - what are they, will they '
             'make me healthy and how do I get some?  To find out I took the '
             'unusual , and rather disgusting, step of donating my poo to '
             'science.  Microbes live on, and in, all of us and they even '
             'outnumber our own human cells.  But their favourite spot - and '
             'where they live in incredible numbers - is our digestive '
             "system.  That\\'s why I posted my faeces to the British Gut "
             'Project for analysis.  "You\\\'re not exactly average, but '
             'you\\\'re not way off the chart either," its director, Prof Tim '
             'Spector, tells me.  The bacteria in my stool were studied not '
             'with a microscope, but with powerful tools to identify them by '
             'their genetic code.  It showed I was missing whole groups of '
             'bacteria. One area of concern was my _Firmicutes_ , as I had '
             'fewer than other people.  "They\\\'re generally the ones that '
             "have your beneficial microbes in it, suggesting you\\'ve got "
             'less general diversity than the average person," Prof Spector '
             'told me.  "The less diversity you have, the less healthy your '
             'gut. It\\\'s not a good thing."  A deeper trawl uncovered I had '
             'high levels of _Akkermansia_ , which "is generally seen in '
             'people who are lean and healthy". But I was also harbouring '
             'those linked with inflammation.  There is growing interest in '
             'understanding the health consequences of the microbiome.  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## The microbiome  \\n \\n \\n '
             "\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n    * You\\'re more microbe than "
             'human - if you count all the cells in your body, only 43% are '
             'human  \\n    * The rest is our microbiome and includes '
             'bacteria, viruses, fungi and single-celled archaea. \\n    * The '
             'human genome - the full set of genetic instructions for a human '
             'being - is made up of 20,000 instructions called genes.  \\n    '
             '* But add all the genes in our microbiome together and the '
             'figure comes out between 2 million and 20 million microbial '
             "genes.  \\n    * It\\'s known as The Second Genome and is linked "
             'to diseases including allergy, obesity, inflammatory bowel '
             "disease, Parkinson\\'s, whether cancer drugs work and even "
             'depression and autism.  \\n  More than half your body is not '
             'human  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Are "bad" bacteria '
             'or too few of the good ones causing disease?  Prof Spector '
             'argues the microbiome is the "most important, exciting thing in '
             'medicine today" and that "diversity" - having as wide a range of '
             'different species as possible - is key.  Clearly I could do with '
             'some improvement. So here are the tips I picked up along the way '
             'while making The Second Genome series.  ## Fibre, fibre... '
             'fibre  Researchers Eric Alm and Lawrence David have some of the '
             'most studied microbiomes on the planet.  They spent a year '
             'analysing 548 of their stool samples.  Lawrence David, an '
             'assistant professor at the Duke Center for Genomic and '
             'Computational Biology, said diet had the biggest influence on '
             'the microbiome - and one thing was especially effective.  He '
             'says: "One of the leading sets of molecules that people are '
             'getting excited about have to do with plants, specifically '
             'fibre.  "It\\\'s what at least some bacteria in the gut love to '
             'eat."  He says plant fibre is likely to benefit most people\\\'s '
             'microbiome, though he admits the study has just made him feel '
             'more guilty about the food he eats.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  "I still eat hamburgers and chicken nuggets," he '
             "confides.  ## Fermented foods \\'the future\\'  Fibre is a "
             'prebiotic, providing fuel for the microbes that are in our '
             'digestive system.  But Dr Paul Cotter, who I met at the '
             "University of Cork, is concerned we\\'re not introducing enough "
             'new microbes into our bodies.  He told me: "An awful lot of what '
             'we eat now are foods within tins or with an awful lot of '
             'shelf-life and they have a long shelf-life simply because there '
             'are very few, or not any, microbes within them."  His field is '
             'fermented foods that bacteria have gone to town on before you '
             'eat them.  Fermented foods include well-known favourites, such '
             'as cheese and yoghurt, but also the milk drink kefir, a tea '
             'called kumbucha and certain cabbage dishes, such as sauerkraut '
             'or the Korean kimchi.  BBC Good Food: A guide to fermented '
             'foods  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Cotter says most '
             'people should be thinking of adding fermented foods to their '
             'diet as the microbes in them help calibrate the immune system.  '
             'He said: "If you\\\'re already healthy, the way to go is consume '
             'fermented food rather than going for a particular probiotic" - '
             'although studies have shown some probiotic products can help '
             'prevent necrotising enterocolitis and diarrhoea in some cases.  '

             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  "Good bacteria" - what are they, will they '
             'make me healthy and how do I get some?  To find out I took the '
             'unusual , and rather disgusting, step of donating my poo to '
             'science.  Microbes live on, and in, all of us and they even '
             'outnumber our own human cells.  But their favourite spot - and '
             'where they live in incredible numbers - is our digestive '
             "system.  That\\'s why I posted my faeces to the British Gut "
             'Project for analysis.  "You\\\'re not exactly average, but '
             'you\\\'re not way off the chart either," its director, Prof Tim '
             'Spector, tells me.  The bacteria in my stool were studied not '
             'with a microscope, but with powerful tools to identify them by '
             'their genetic code.  It showed I was missing whole groups of '
             'bacteria. One area of concern was my _Firmicutes_ , as I had '
             'fewer than other people.  "They\\\'re generally the ones that '
             "have your beneficial microbes in it, suggesting you\\'ve got "
             'less general diversity than the average person," Prof Spector '
             'told me.  "The less diversity you have, the less healthy your '
             'gut. It\\\'s not a good thing."  A deeper trawl uncovered I had '
             'high levels of _Akkermansia_ , which "is generally seen in '
             'people who are lean and healthy". But I was also harbouring '
             'those linked with inflammation.  There is growing interest in '
             'understanding the health consequences of the microbiome.  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## The microbiome  \\n \\n \\n '
             "\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n    * You\\'re more microbe than "
             'human - if you count all the cells in your body, only 43% are '
             'human  \\n    * The rest is our microbiome and includes '
             'bacteria, viruses, fungi and single-celled archaea. \\n    * The '
             'human genome - the full set of genetic instructions for a human '
             'being - is made up of 20,000 instructions called genes.  \\n    '
             '* But add all the genes in our microbiome together and the '
             'figure comes out between 2 million and 20 million microbial '
             "genes.  \\n    * It\\'s known as The Second Genome and is linked "
             'to diseases including allergy, obesity, inflammatory bowel '
             "disease, Parkinson\\'s, whether cancer drugs work and even "
             'depression and autism.  \\n  More than half your body is not '
             'human  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Are "bad" bacteria '
             'or too few of the good ones causing disease?  Prof Spector '
             'argues the microbiome is the "most important, exciting thing in '
             'medicine today" and that "diversity" - having as wide a range of '
             'different species as possible - is key.  Clearly I could do with '
             'some improvement. So here are the tips I picked up along the way '
             'while making The Second Genome series.  ## Fibre, fibre... '
             'fibre  Researchers Eric Alm and Lawrence David have some of the '
             'most studied microbiomes on the planet.  They spent a year '
             'analysing 548 of their stool samples.  Lawrence David, an '
             'assistant professor at the Duke Center for Genomic and '
             'Computational Biology, said diet had the biggest influence on '
             'the microbiome - and one thing was especially effective.  He '
             'says: "One of the leading sets of molecules that people are '
             'getting excited about have to do with plants, specifically '
             'fibre.  "It\\\'s what at least some bacteria in the gut love to '
             'eat."  He says plant fibre is likely to benefit most people\\\'s '
             'microbiome, though he admits the study has just made him feel '
             'more guilty about the food he eats.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  "I still eat hamburgers and chicken nuggets," he '
             "confides.  ## Fermented foods \\'the future\\'  Fibre is a "
             'prebiotic, providing fuel for the microbes that are in our '
             'digestive system.  But Dr Paul Cotter, who I met at the '
             "University of Cork, is concerned we\\'re not introducing enough "
             'new microbes into our bodies.  He told me: "An awful lot of what '
             'we eat now are foods within tins or with an awful lot of '
             'shelf-life and they have a long shelf-life simply because there '
             'are very few, or not any, microbes within them."  His field is '
             'fermented foods that bacteria have gone to town on before you '
             'eat them.  Fermented foods include well-known favourites, such '
             'as cheese and yoghurt, but also the milk drink kefir, a tea '
             'called kumbucha and certain cabbage dishes, such as sauerkraut '
             'or the Korean kimchi.  BBC Good Food: A guide to fermented '
             'foods  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Cotter says most '
             'people should be thinking of adding fermented foods to their '
             'diet as the microbes in them help calibrate the immune system.  '
             'He said: "If you\\\'re already healthy, the way to go is consume '
             'fermented food rather than going for a particular probiotic" - '
             'although studies have shown some probiotic products can help '
             'prevent necrotising enterocolitis and diarrhoea in some cases.  '

             'superfood that would make you live longer, would you be '
             'interested?  Naturally it reduces the chances of debilitating '
             'heart attacks and strokes as well as life-long diseases such as '
             'type-2 diabetes.  And it helps keep your weight, blood pressure '
             "and cholesterol levels down.  I should mention it\\'s cheap and "
             'widely available in the supermarket.  ## What is it?  Fibre - '
             "it\\'s not the sexiest thing in the world but a major study has "
             'been investigating how much fibre we really need to be eating '
             'and found there are huge health benefits.  "The evidence is now '
             'overwhelming and this is a game-changer that people have to '
             'start doing something about it," one of the researchers, Prof '
             "John Cummings, tells BBC News.  It\\'s well known for stopping "
             'constipation - but its health benefits are much broader than '
             'that.  ## How much fibre do we need?  The researchers, at the '
             'University of Otago, in New Zealand, and the University of '
             'Dundee say people should be eating a minimum of 25g of fibre per '
             'day.  But they call this an "adequate" amount for improving '
             'health and say there are benefits for pushing past 30g (1oz).  '
             '## Is that all?  Well, a banana on its own weighs about 120g but '
             "that\\'s not pure fibre. Strip out everything else including all "
             "the natural sugars and water, and you\\'re left with only about "
             '3g of fibre.  Most people around the world are eating less than '
             '20g of fibre a day.  And in the UK, fewer than one in 10 adults '
             'eats 30g of fibre daily.  On average, women consume about 17g, '
             'and men 21g, a day.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '

             '\\n Fibre is present in fruit, vegetables, wholegrain bread, '
             'pasta and lentils\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## What other foods have more '
             'fibre in them?  You find it in fruit and vegetables, some '
             'breakfast cereals, breads and pasta that use whole-grains, '
             'pulses such as beans, lentils and chickpeas, as well as nuts and '
             'seeds.  BBC Food: How carb-clever are you?  ## What does 30g '
             'look like?  Elaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland '
             'University of Technology, has put together this example for '
             'getting into the 25-30g camp:    * half a cup of rolled oats - '
             '9g fibre | **two Weetabix - 3g fibre** | a thick slice of brown '
             'bread - 2g fibre | **a cup of cooked lentils - 4g fibre** | a '
             'potato cooked with the skin on - 2g fibre | **half a cup of '
             'chard (or silverbeet in New Zealand) - 1g fibre** | a carrot - '
             '3g fibre | **an apple with the skin on - 4g fibre** \\n  But she '
             'says: "It is not easy to increase fibre in the diet."  Prof '
             'Cummings agrees. "It\\\'s a big change for people," he says. '
             '"It\\\'s quite a challenge."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Are there any quick '
             "and easy tips?  The UK\\'s National Health Service has a page "
             'full of them.  They include:    * cooking potatoes with the skin '
             'on | **swapping white bread, pasta and rice for wholemeal '
             'versions** | choosing high-fibre breakfast cereals such as '
             'porridge oats | **chucking some chickpeas, beans or lentils in a '
             'curry or over a salad** | having nuts or fresh fruit for snacks '
             'or dessert | **consuming at least five portions of fruit or '
             'vegetables each day** \\n  BBC Food: High fibre breakfasts  ## '
             'What will the benefit be?  Well, after analysing 185 studies and '
             '58 clinical trials, the results are in and have been published '
             'in the Lancet medical journal.  It suggests if you shifted 1,000 '
             'people from a low fibre diet (less than 15g) to a high-fibre one '
             '(25-29g), then it would prevent 13 deaths and six cases of heart '
             "disease.  That\\'s during the course of these studies, which "
             'tended to follow people for one to two decades.  It also showed '
             'lower levels of type-2 diabetes and bowel cancer as well as '
             'lower weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  And the '
             'more fibre people ate, the better.  ## What is fibre doing in '
             "the body?  There used to be a view that fibre didn\\'t do much "
             'at all - that the human body could not digest it and it just '
             'sailed through.  But fibre makes us feel full and affects the '
             'way fat is absorbed in the small intestine - and things really '
             'become interesting in the large intestines, when your gut '
             'bacteria get to have their dinner.  The large intestines are '
             "home to billions of bacteria - and fibre is their food.  It\\'s "
             "a bit like a brewery down there, admittedly one you wouldn\\'t "
             'want a pint from, where bacteria are fermenting fibre to make a '
             'whole load of chemicals.  This includes short-chain fatty acids, '
             'which are absorbed and have effects throughout the body.  "We '
             'have this organ set up to digest fibre, which a lot of people '
             'just don\\\'t use very much," says Prof Cummings.  ## Why is '
             'this relevant now?  The fact fibre and whole-grains and fruit '
             'and vegetables are healthy should not come as a surprise.  But '
             'there is concern people are turning their back on fibre, with '
             'the popularity of low-carb diets.  Prof Nita Forouhi, from the '
             'University of Cambridge, says: "We need to take serious note of '
             'this study.  "Its findings do imply that, though increasingly '
             'popular in the community at large, any dietary regimes that '
             'recommend very low-carbohydrate diets should consider the '
             'opportunity cost of missing out on fibre from whole-grains.  '
             '"This research confirms that fibre and whole-grain intakes are '
             'clearly important for longer term health."  The study has been '
             'done to help the World Health Organization come up with official '
             'guidelines for how much fibre people should be eating to boost '
             'health and they are expected next year.  Follow James on '
             'Twitter  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Analysis from '
             'BBC Reality Check  One of the suggested ways of boosting the '
             'amount of fibre in your diet is to switch from white bread to '
             'brown or wholemeal.  This is what has been happening to sales of '
             'those products, based on a succession of government surveys of '
             'household spending since 1974.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n  From the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties, white bread '
             'fell while brown and wholemeal rose.  Since then, white bread '
             'sales have continued to fall, but brown and wholemeal bread '
             'sales have been falling for most of that period, although at a '
             'slower rate.  So it looks as if while overall demand for bread '
             'has been falling, a higher proportion of bread sold has been '
             'higher fibre.  Whole wheat pasta has made less of an impact on '
             'sales than higher fibre breads, with a survey for the British '
             'Journal of Nutrition finding that pasta accounted for less than '
             '1% of the occasions on which people were consuming whole '

             'could extend your life?\\n \\n \\n \\n  If I offered you a '
             'superfood that would make you live longer, would you be '
             'interested?  Naturally it reduces the chances of debilitating '
             'heart attacks and strokes as well as life-long diseases such as '
             'type-2 diabetes.  And it helps keep your weight, blood pressure '
             "and cholesterol levels down.  I should mention it\\'s cheap and "
             'widely available in the supermarket.  ## What is it?  Fibre - '
             "it\\'s not the sexiest thing in the world but a major study has "
             'been investigating how much fibre we really need to be eating '
             'and found there are huge health benefits.  "The evidence is now '
             'overwhelming and this is a game-changer that people have to '
             'start doing something about it," one of the researchers, Prof '
             "John Cummings, tells BBC News.  It\\'s well known for stopping "
             'constipation - but its health benefits are much broader than '
             'that.  ## How much fibre do we need?  The researchers, at the '
             'University of Otago, in New Zealand, and the University of '
             'Dundee say people should be eating a minimum of 25g of fibre per '
             'day.  But they call this an "adequate" amount for improving '
             'health and say there are benefits for pushing past 30g (1oz).  '
             '## Is that all?  Well, a banana on its own weighs about 120g but '
             "that\\'s not pure fibre. Strip out everything else including all "
             "the natural sugars and water, and you\\'re left with only about "
             '3g of fibre.  Most people around the world are eating less than '
             '20g of fibre a day.  And in the UK, fewer than one in 10 adults '
             'eats 30g of fibre daily.  On average, women consume about 17g, '
             'and men 21g, a day.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '

             '\\n Fibre is present in fruit, vegetables, wholegrain bread, '
             'pasta and lentils\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## What other foods have more '
             'fibre in them?  You find it in fruit and vegetables, some '
             'breakfast cereals, breads and pasta that use whole-grains, '
             'pulses such as beans, lentils and chickpeas, as well as nuts and '
             'seeds.  BBC Food: How carb-clever are you?  ## What does 30g '
             'look like?  Elaine Rush, a professor of nutrition at Auckland '
             'University of Technology, has put together this example for '
             'getting into the 25-30g camp:    * half a cup of rolled oats - '
             '9g fibre | **two Weetabix - 3g fibre** | a thick slice of brown '
             'bread - 2g fibre | **a cup of cooked lentils - 4g fibre** | a '
             'potato cooked with the skin on - 2g fibre | **half a cup of '
             'chard (or silverbeet in New Zealand) - 1g fibre** | a carrot - '
             '3g fibre | **an apple with the skin on - 4g fibre** \\n  But she '
             'says: "It is not easy to increase fibre in the diet."  Prof '
             'Cummings agrees. "It\\\'s a big change for people," he says. '
             '"It\\\'s quite a challenge."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Are there any quick '
             "and easy tips?  The UK\\'s National Health Service has a page "
             'full of them.  They include:    * cooking potatoes with the skin '
             'on | **swapping white bread, pasta and rice for wholemeal '
             'versions** | choosing high-fibre breakfast cereals such as '
             'porridge oats | **chucking some chickpeas, beans or lentils in a '
             'curry or over a salad** | having nuts or fresh fruit for snacks '
             'or dessert | **consuming at least five portions of fruit or '
             'vegetables each day** \\n  BBC Food: High fibre breakfasts  ## '
             'What will the benefit be?  Well, after analysing 185 studies and '
             '58 clinical trials, the results are in and have been published '
             'in the Lancet medical journal.  It suggests if you shifted 1,000 '
             'people from a low fibre diet (less than 15g) to a high-fibre one '
             '(25-29g), then it would prevent 13 deaths and six cases of heart '
             "disease.  That\\'s during the course of these studies, which "
             'tended to follow people for one to two decades.  It also showed '
             'lower levels of type-2 diabetes and bowel cancer as well as '
             'lower weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  And the '
             'more fibre people ate, the better.  ## What is fibre doing in '
             "the body?  There used to be a view that fibre didn\\'t do much "
             'at all - that the human body could not digest it and it just '
             'sailed through.  But fibre makes us feel full and affects the '
             'way fat is absorbed in the small intestine - and things really '
             'become interesting in the large intestines, when your gut '
             'bacteria get to have their dinner.  The large intestines are '
             "home to billions of bacteria - and fibre is their food.  It\\'s "
             "a bit like a brewery down there, admittedly one you wouldn\\'t "
             'want a pint from, where bacteria are fermenting fibre to make a '
             'whole load of chemicals.  This includes short-chain fatty acids, '
             'which are absorbed and have effects throughout the body.  "We '
             'have this organ set up to digest fibre, which a lot of people '
             'just don\\\'t use very much," says Prof Cummings.  ## Why is '
             'this relevant now?  The fact fibre and whole-grains and fruit '
             'and vegetables are healthy should not come as a surprise.  But '
             'there is concern people are turning their back on fibre, with '
             'the popularity of low-carb diets.  Prof Nita Forouhi, from the '
             'University of Cambridge, says: "We need to take serious note of '
             'this study.  "Its findings do imply that, though increasingly '
             'popular in the community at large, any dietary regimes that '
             'recommend very low-carbohydrate diets should consider the '
             'opportunity cost of missing out on fibre from whole-grains.  '
             '"This research confirms that fibre and whole-grain intakes are '
             'clearly important for longer term health."  The study has been '
             'done to help the World Health Organization come up with official '
             'guidelines for how much fibre people should be eating to boost '
             'health and they are expected next year.  Follow James on '
             'Twitter  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Analysis from '
             'BBC Reality Check  One of the suggested ways of boosting the '
             'amount of fibre in your diet is to switch from white bread to '
             'brown or wholemeal.  This is what has been happening to sales of '
             'those products, based on a succession of government surveys of '
             'household spending since 1974.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n  From the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties, white bread '
             'fell while brown and wholemeal rose.  Since then, white bread '
             'sales have continued to fall, but brown and wholemeal bread '
             'sales have been falling for most of that period, although at a '
             'slower rate.  So it looks as if while overall demand for bread '
             'has been falling, a higher proportion of bread sold has been '
             'higher fibre.  Whole wheat pasta has made less of an impact on '
             'sales than higher fibre breads, with a survey for the British '
             'Journal of Nutrition finding that pasta accounted for less than '
             '1% of the occasions on which people were consuming whole '
             'grains.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n',

             'food we eat is putting 11 million of us into an early grave each '
             'year, an influential study shows.  The analysis, in the Lancet, '
             'found that our daily diet is a bigger killer than smoking and is '
             'now involved in one in five deaths around the world.  Salt - '
             'whether in bread, soy sauce or processed meals - shortened the '
             'highest number of lives.  Researchers say this study is not '
             'about obesity, but "poor quality" diets damaging hearts and '
             'causing cancer.  ## So which diets have got it in for me?  The '
             'Global Burden of Disease Study is the most authoritative '
             'assessment of how people are dying in every country in the '
             "world.  The latest analysis used estimates of countries\\' "
             'eating habits to pin down how often diet was shortening lives.  '
             'The dangerous diets were those containing:  \\n    1. Too much '
             'salt - three million deaths \\n    2. Too few whole grains - '
             'three million deaths \\n    3. Too little fruit - two million '
             'deaths \\n  Low levels of nuts, seeds, vegetables, omega-3 from '
             'seafood and fibre were the other major killers.  "We find that '
             'diet is one of the dominant drivers of health around the world, '
             'it\\\'s really quite profound," Prof Christopher Murray, the '
             'director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at '
             'the University of Washington told the BBC.  ## How is this '
             'killing people?  About 10 million out of the 11 million '
             'diet-related deaths were because of cardiovascular disease and '
             'that explains why salt is such a problem.  Too much salt raises '
             'blood pressure and that in turn raises the risk of heart attacks '

             'direct effect on the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart '
             'failure when the organ does not work effectively.  Whole grains, '
             'fruit and vegetables have the opposite effect - they are '
             '"cardioprotective" and lower the risk of heart problems.  '
             'Cancers and type 2 diabetes made up the rest of the diet-related '
             'deaths.  ## How far is the world off a perfect diet?  No country '
             'is perfect and each favours some part of a healthy diet more '
             'than others, but this is how far the world is from an optimal '

             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Nuts and seeds again?  The healthy foods '
             'missing from the most diets around the world were nuts and '
             'seeds, according to the study.  Eager readers will have noticed '
             'they featured heavily in the planetary health diet, unveiled in '
             'January, to save lives, save the planet and feed 10 billion '
             "people.  So why don\\'t we munch them?  Prof Nita Forouhi, from "
             'the University of Cambridge, said: "The perception is they are '
             'little packs of energy that will make you fat, whereas they are '
             'packed full of good fats.  "And most people don\\\'t see them as '
             'mainstream food; and the other issue is cost."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             'Image caption\\n \\n Nuts - they are not just for squirrels.\\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  ## I thought meat and sugar were the bad guys?  The '
             'huge fat versus sugar debate and the link between red and '
             'processed meats with cancer have attracted huge headlines in '
             'recent years.  "These can be harmful as we show, but they are '
             'much smaller issues than low whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds '
             'and vegetable intake," said Prof Murray.  Although, the study '
             'did show too many fizzy drinks were being drunk in every corner '
             'of the world.  The researchers say it is time for health '
             'campaigns to switch from talking about nutrients like fat and '
             'sugar and instead promote healthy foods.  ## But is a tasty '
             'unhealthy diet worth it?  Bad diets are knocking a couple of '
             'years off life expectancies around the world, according to the '
             'researchers.  But Prof Murray warns this is just the average and '
             'says the real question we should be asking is: "Am I going to '
             'die in my 50s from a heart attack? Or am I going to have some of '
             'the diet-related cancers in my 40s?"  ## Are any countries doing '
             'well?  Mediterranean countries, particularly France, Spain and '
             'Israel, have some of the lowest numbers of diet-related deaths '
             'in the world.  Countries in South East, Southern and Central '
             'Asia are at the opposite end of the spectrum.  \\n    * Israel '
             'has the lowest diet-related deaths - 89 per 100,000 people a '
             'year \\n    * Uzbekistan has the highest diet-related deaths - '
             '892 per 100,000 people a year \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Japan and China '
             'have curiously contrasting fortunes that reflect their changing '
             'relationship with salt.  China consumes enormous amounts of salt '
             'with soy and other salty sauces being a key part of the '
             "country\\'s cuisine.  But the rising popularity of processed "
             'foods is introducing yet more salt to their diet. It has the '
             'highest death rate because of salt of any country.  Prof Murray '
             'said: "Japan is very interesting because if you go back 30 to 40 '
             'years, they like China today had enormous salt intake.  "Salt is '
             'still their number one problem, but it has come down '
             'dramatically,  "And they have a diet that is higher in many of '
             'the things we think are protective for heart disease such as '
             'vegetables and fruit."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n '
             '\\n Soy sauce is high in salt\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## What about the '
             'UK?  The UK is behind countries like France, Denmark and '
             'Belgium.  The biggest problems are a lack of whole grains, '
             'fruit, vegetables and nuts and seeds.  The study estimates 14% '
             'of UK deaths are related to diet, with 127 diet- related deaths '
             'per 100,000 people a year.  ## Any advice?  Prof Murray said: '
             '"Diet quality matters no matter what weight you are.  "The '
             'really big story for people to act on is increase your whole '
             'grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake and reduce salt '
             'if you can."  But money is an issue.  It is estimated that '
             'having your five fruit and veg a day would take up 52% of '
             'household income in poorer countries.  But Prof Forouhi warns: '
             '"The public can make healthier choices if informed and have the '
             'resources, but if what is on the shelves as buy-one-get-one-free '
             'is always unhealthy, then that message will fall down.  "Cheaper '
             'options that are healthy are badly needed."  Both agreed there '
             'needed to be a shift from focusing on nutrients (fat/sugar/salt) '
             'and on to which actual foods people should eat.  Follow James on '

             'in the world.  Countries in South East, Southern and Central '
             'Asia are at the opposite end of the spectrum.  \\n    * Israel '
             'has the lowest diet-related deaths - 89 per 100,000 people a '
             'year \\n    * Uzbekistan has the highest diet-related deaths - '
             '892 per 100,000 people a year \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Japan and China '
             'have curiously contrasting fortunes that reflect their changing '
             'relationship with salt.  China consumes enormous amounts of salt '
             'with soy and other salty sauces being a key part of the '
             "country\\'s cuisine.  But the rising popularity of processed "
             'foods is introducing yet more salt to their diet. It has the '
             'highest death rate because of salt of any country.  Prof Murray '
             'said: "Japan is very interesting because if you go back 30 to 40 '
             'years, they like China today had enormous salt intake.  "Salt is '
             'still their number one problem, but it has come down '
             'dramatically,  "And they have a diet that is higher in many of '
             'the things we think are protective for heart disease such as '
             'vegetables and fruit."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n '
             '\\n Soy sauce is high in salt\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## What about the '
             'UK?  The UK is behind countries like France, Denmark and '
             'Belgium.  The biggest problems are a lack of whole grains, '
             'fruit, vegetables and nuts and seeds.  The study estimates 14% '
             'of UK deaths are related to diet, with 127 diet- related deaths '
             'per 100,000 people a year.  ## Any advice?  Prof Murray said: '
             '"Diet quality matters no matter what weight you are.  "The '
             'really big story for people to act on is increase your whole '
             'grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake and reduce salt '
             'if you can."  But money is an issue.  It is estimated that '
             'having your five fruit and veg a day would take up 52% of '
             'household income in poorer countries.  But Prof Forouhi warns: '
             '"The public can make healthier choices if informed and have the '
             'resources, but if what is on the shelves as buy-one-get-one-free '
             'is always unhealthy, then that message will fall down.  "Cheaper '
             'options that are healthy are badly needed."  Both agreed there '
             'needed to be a shift from focusing on nutrients (fat/sugar/salt) '
             'and on to which actual foods people should eat.  Follow James on '

             'London team said a new definition for constipation was needed, '

             'and hard stools - normal can range from three times a day to '
             'three times a week \\n    * sensory dysfunction - not having the '

             'researchers surveyed 2,557 members of the public, 411 GPs and '
             '365 gastroenterology specialists.  They found that what most '

             '\\n A lack of fibre in the diet can be a cause of '
             'constipation\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## What do the researchers say?  Dr '
             "Eirini Dimidi, study author from King\\'s College London, said: "
             '"Our research may indicate that people who seek help for '
             "symptoms of constipation don\\'t always have them recognised, "
             'diagnosed or managed."  She said constipation was usually caused '
             'by a lack of fibre or fluid in the diet but it could also be a '
             'sign of another underlying problem, such as bowel cancer, '
             'diverticular disease or coeliac disease.  Dr Dimidi said it was '
             '"always important to consult your doctor if you experience gut '
             'symptoms".  ## What about other experts?  Listening to what '
             'patients say about constipation is so important, said Julie '
             'Harrington, from charity Guts UK.  "Patients are the experts, by '
             'experience, and when they come together with specialists, '
             'that\\\'s the sweet spot."  Not all constipation is the same, '
             'and different people have different symptoms, she added.  "Bowel '
             'problems are less likely to be picked up than other problems '
             'because people wait 6-12 months out of fear and embarrassment.  '
             '"You have to tune into your body."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '
             'Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## How often '
             'should we poo?  This is difficult to answer - it can vary '
             'dramatically from person to person.  In the study, seven bowel '
             "movements a week was the average among people who weren\\'t "
             'constipated.  But experts say three bowel movements a day to '
             "three a week qualifies as normal.  So you need to know what\\'s "
             'normal for you - and then look out for changes.  ## What are the '
             'treatment options?  Most people recognise the problem themselves '
             'and try to solve it by increasing the fibre in their diet and '
             'drinking more fluid, according to NHS advice.  Fibre is present '
             'in wholegrain bread, wholegrain pasta, fruit, nuts, pulses and '
             'cereals.  Taking more exercise and eating regular meals can also '
             'help.  You can buy laxatives from the chemist if diet and '
             "lifestyle changes aren\\'t working.  But it\\'s important to see "
             'your GP if the problem persists, and you have other symptoms.  '

             'scientists analysing a 3,000 mile run, the Tour de France and '
             'other elite events.  They showed the cap was 2.5 times the '
             "body\\'s resting metabolic rate, or 4,000 calories a day for an "
             'average person.  Anything higher than that was not sustainable '
             'in the long term.  The research, by Duke University, also showed '
             'pregnant women were endurance specialists, living at nearly the '
             'limit of what the human body can cope with.  The study started '
             'with the Race Across the USA in which athletes ran 3,080 miles '
             'from California to Washington DC in 140 days.  Competitors were '
             'running six marathons a week for months, and scientists were '
             'investigating the effect on their bodies.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'relaxing - was recorded before and during the race.  And '
             'calories burned in the extreme endurance event were recorded.  '
             'The study, in Science Advances, showed energy use started off '
             'high but eventually levelled off at 2.5 times the resting '
             'metabolic rate.  The study found a pattern between the length of '
             'a sporting event and energy expenditure; and that while running '
             'a marathon may be beyond many, it is nowhere near the limit of '

             'you have to dial it back," Dr Herman Pontzer, from Duke '

             'in London there was an even steeper drop.  PHE said increased '

             'been frustration at a lack of progress in reducing the number of '
             'men being diagnosed each year.  New infections in the UK had '
             'been stuck at about 3,000 every year in the five years up to '
             "2015.  ## \\'First downturn\\'  Valerie Delpech, head of HIV "
             'surveillance for Public Health England, said: "What we are '
             'seeing is the first downturn of the HIV epidemic in gay men."  '
             'She added: "There is absolutely no reason why we cannot scale '
             'that up to further reduce new infections in gay men - and also '
             'in all people who may be at risk of HIV in the UK, regardless of '
             'gender, ethnicity or sexuality."  Published in the journal '
             'Eurosurveillance, the PHE study looked at data from 200 sexual '
             'health clinics in England.  It found that new diagnoses of HIV '
             'in gay or bisexual men at five busy London clinics, where Prep '
             'is being trialled, had decreased from 880 in 2014-15 to 595 in '
             '2015-16 - a drop of 32%.  And this drop had occurred despite the '
             'number of these men being tested in these clinics rising by 50% '
             'over the same period.  At 30 other London clinics, new diagnoses '
             'fell by just 8%.  And in 191 clinics across England, the drop '
             'was about 5%.  Overall, this amounted to a 17% fall in England.  '
             'Among heterosexuals, who are not included in the Prep trial, new '
             "HIV diagnoses did not fall - staying at about 1,500.  ## \\'All "
             "weapons\\'  Dr Michael Brady, medical director of Terrence "
             'Higgins Trust, said after years of high rates of HIV diagnoses '
             'among gay and bisexual men, such a sharp drop in England was '
             '"remarkable".  "This points towards what can be achieved when we '
             'utilise all the weapons in our arsenal against HIV '
             'transmission," he said.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  "This includes access '
             'to condoms, testing, Prep and diagnosing and treating people as '
             'early as possible so they can become uninfectious."  However, he '
             'said, there was no place for complacency.  In England, eight '
             'clinics in London and several outside the capital have taken '
             'part in a trial of the so-called "game-changer" drug Prep, which '
             'is taken by HIV negative people before sex to reduce the chance '
             'of getting HIV.  Scotland has announced it will make Prep '
             'available on the NHS to people at risk of HIV . And in Wales, '
             'the government has decided to start trialling the drug.  But Dr '
             'Brady said the drug should be available to all those at risk, as '
             'soon as possible, regardless of where they lived.  Deborah Gold, '
             'chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: "These are '
             'incredibly exciting times for HIV.  "We are on the precipice of '
             'an absolute step-change in HIV prevention."  However, she said, '
             'further investment in HIV prevention was under threat.  "Without '
             'proper investment in prevention, HIV will remain a significant '
             'health inequality."  \\n',

             'in all people who may be at risk of HIV in the UK, regardless of '
             'gender, ethnicity or sexuality."  Published in the journal '
             'Eurosurveillance, the PHE study looked at data from 200 sexual '
             'health clinics in England.  It found that new diagnoses of HIV '
             'in gay or bisexual men at five busy London clinics, where Prep '
             'is being trialled, had decreased from 880 in 2014-15 to 595 in '
             '2015-16 - a drop of 32%.  And this drop had occurred despite the '
             'number of these men being tested in these clinics rising by 50% '
             'over the same period.  At 30 other London clinics, new diagnoses '
             'fell by just 8%.  And in 191 clinics across England, the drop '
             'was about 5%.  Overall, this amounted to a 17% fall in England.  '
             'Among heterosexuals, who are not included in the Prep trial, new '
             "HIV diagnoses did not fall - staying at about 1,500.  ## \\'All "
             "weapons\\'  Dr Michael Brady, medical director of Terrence "
             'Higgins Trust, said after years of high rates of HIV diagnoses '
             'among gay and bisexual men, such a sharp drop in England was '
             '"remarkable".  "This points towards what can be achieved when we '
             'utilise all the weapons in our arsenal against HIV '
             'transmission," he said.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  "This includes access '
             'to condoms, testing, Prep and diagnosing and treating people as '
             'early as possible so they can become uninfectious."  However, he '
             'said, there was no place for complacency.  In England, eight '
             'clinics in London and several outside the capital have taken '
             'part in a trial of the so-called "game-changer" drug Prep, which '
             'is taken by HIV negative people before sex to reduce the chance '
             'of getting HIV.  Scotland has announced it will make Prep '
             'available on the NHS to people at risk of HIV . And in Wales, '
             'the government has decided to start trialling the drug.  But Dr '
             'Brady said the drug should be available to all those at risk, as '
             'soon as possible, regardless of where they lived.  Deborah Gold, '
             'chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said: "These are '
             'incredibly exciting times for HIV.  "We are on the precipice of '
             'an absolute step-change in HIV prevention."  However, she said, '
             'further investment in HIV prevention was under threat.  "Without '
             'proper investment in prevention, HIV will remain a significant '
             'health inequality."  \\n',

             "\\n \\n  Endometriosis isn\\'t just painful periods, it\\'s a "
             'chronic condition in a league of its own.  One in 10 women has '
             'it yet, in the UK, it takes on average seven years to get it '
             'correctly diagnosed by a doctor - something experts want to '
             'change.  With endometriosis, tissue that behaves like womb '
             'lining is found in other bits of the body, causing nasty '
             'symptoms.  Amelia Davies was 12 when she got her first period. '
             'She soon came to dread her "agonising Auntie Red".  "At times it '
             "was so bad I couldn\\'t go to school. I missed loads of days. "
             'The pain was really intense, with lots of different types - '
             "stabbing, cramping and burning. I was so bad I couldn\\'t walk "
             'or get out of bed."  New guidelines for the NHS aim to reduce '
             'delays in diagnosis and save women years of unnecessary distress '
             'and suffering.  ## Crippling pain  Amelia first explained her '
             'symptoms to her GP and then a few different doctors, but they '
             'couldn\\\'t find anything wrong.  "Finally, they agreed to send '
             'me to hospital for an ultrasound scan.  "So, there I am sitting '
             'in the hospital waiting room in full school uniform with dad '
             'laughing and joking about to try and keep me calm. It felt like '
             'people in that waiting room were giving me dirty looks, and '
             'assuming I was there for a pregnancy scan or something. I felt '
             'judged."  The scan revealed she had a cyst on her ovary, plus '
             'endometriosis.  When a woman with endometriosis menstruates, the '
             'misplaced womb tissue bleeds too, causing crippling pain and '
             'some rather unusual symptoms.  Some women pee blood at their '
             'time of the month. Others even cough up some blood if the rogue '
             'tissue is in their lungs.  Over time, the bleeding can irritate '
             'the body and lead to scarring or adhesions - tough cords of '
             'fibrous tissue that can cause more pain and make organs stick to '
             "each other and cause complications.  Amelia\\'s doctor advised "
             'her to take an oral contraceptive pill to help alleviate her '
             "symptoms.  She currently takes the mini pill and hasn\\'t had a "
             'period in two years.  But Amelia, now 18 and living in south '
             'London, says her endometriosis still causes her daily pain. '
             'She\\\'s been writing a blog about her experiences.  "Sometimes '
             "it can be really bad still. I get flare-ups and that\\'s really "
             'difficult.  "I get the phrase, \\\'At least you\\\'re not '
             'dying,\\\' quite a lot.  "I know it\\\'s said most of the time '
             'by good friends who are trying to be nice and reassure me. But '
             'endometriosis for me is the prospect of a long life full of '
             'pain. I sometimes feel like people are measuring my level of '
             "struggle against others\\' and that doesn\\'t feel fair. It\\'s "
             'daunting."  Caroline Overton, a consultant gynaecologist who '
             'helped write the new guidelines from the National Institute for '
             'Health and Care Excellence said: "There is no cure for '
             'endometriosis, so helping affected women manage their symptoms '
             'is imperative.  "As one of the most common gynaecological '
             'diseases in the UK, it is vital that endometriosis is more '
             'widely recognised."  Emma Cox, from Endometriosis UK, said: "The '

             'targets are being missed  The best barometer of this is the '
             'four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of '
             "how good an emergency department is. But it\\'s not. It "
             "doesn\\'t tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you "
             'get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the '
             "signs of a heart attack.  Instead it\\'s a sign of whether the "
             'system is under stress - both in the community and in the '
             'hospital.  Which local services are under threat?  Upfront '
             "charges for foreign patients  When there\\'s perfect harmony "
             'between the numbers arriving and leaving, 95% of patients will '
             "be dealt with in four hours.  But this isn\\'t happening. You "
             'have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was '
             'met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on '
             'year.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  The rest of the UK '
             'is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales '
             'and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, '
             'but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals '
             'have been hovering below the 90% mark in recent weeks.  ## 4\\. '
             "The UK\\'s population is ageing  The ageing population is "
             "certainly a major factor - and it\\'s one that all health "
             'systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have '
             'meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, '
             'life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now.  This is '
             'something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a '
             'significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of '
             'people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death '
             'sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade '
             'or more.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  But this '
             'progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing '
             'number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease '
             'and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what '
             'patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people '
             'will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have '
             'two.  ## 5\\. Care for older people costs much more  The average '
             '65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average '
             '30-year- old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as '
             'much.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  As the numbers '
             'continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded '
             'by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently '
             'considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at £20m '
             'each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost '
             "more than this.  Then there\\'s obesity. A third of adults are "
             'so overweight they are risking their health significantly.  All '
             'this contributes to what health economists call health inflation '
             '- the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal '
             'rise in the cost of living across the economy.  This is why '
             'health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of '
             'government spending.  Over the years this has been achievable '
             'through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more '
             'money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as '
             'defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share '
             'of the public purse.  ## 6\\. Increases in NHS spending have '
             'slowed  But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over '
             'the years governments have varied the amount they were willing '
             'or able to give.  Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average '
             'annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under '
             'Blair and Brown this was considerably higher.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  As you can see the period between 2010 and '
             '2015 saw the tightest financial settlement.  The following two '
             'years were a little more generous, but that average is likely to '
             'drop a little over the rest of the parliament under current '
             'spending plans.  So ministers in England are right to say they '
             "are increasing funding - it\\'s been frozen in Wales and "
             "Scotland - but it\\'s just that it doesn\\'t compare favourably "
             'with what the NHS has traditionally got.  Indeed, the Institute '
             'for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the 10 years to 2020, '
             'the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to '
             'keep pace with the ageing and growing population.  ## 7\\. The '
             'UK spends a lower proportion on health than other EU countries  '
             'But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few '
             'billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other '
             'European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a '
             'proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the '
             'economy.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The result, as you would expect, '
             'is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the '
             'big spenders.  But a number of these countries achieve that by '
             'taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by '
             'Ipsos MORI for the BBC last year is anything to go by, they are '
             'pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would '
             "support National Insurance going up.  Nor does it seem there\\'s "
             'appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against '
             'charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like '
             'some of our European neighbours do.  But even if more money was '
             'spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight '
             'improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and '
             'that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people '
             'wanting to work in key posts.  Trainee posts for GPs are being '
             'increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all.  There also remain '
             'big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for '
             '21st Century healthcare.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  The NHS is still '
             'centred on the network of district general hospitals that '
             'emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s.  But in '
             'an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, '
             'what they really need is support in the community.  The problem '
             "is there\\'s a serious shortage of this. The number of district "
             'nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, '
             'while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly '
             'difficult.  ## 8\\. Demand for A&E is rising  The result is that '
             'people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have '
             'risen by over 40% in 13 years.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Not all of '
             'this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they '
             'tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of '
             'hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population '
             'with a long-term condition.  There are attempts to change this '
             'by placing more emphasis on care outside hospital.  NHS England '
             'chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to '
             'create more integrated care, which involves hospital services '
             'working more closely with their local community teams. Similar '
             'moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  '
             'There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more '
             'active, eat better diets and drink less.  ## 9\\. Fewer older '
             'people are getting help with social care  But perhaps the '
             'biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day '
             'centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and '
             'dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final '
             'years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and '
             'living independently - and out of hospital.  In an era when the '
             'population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting '
             'help from the state.  However, the opposite is true. In England '
             'over the past four years for which we have data, the number of '
             'older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is '
             'large numbers going without care or having to pay for it '
             'themselves.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  The other '
             'parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this '
             'respect - home care is capped at £70 a week in Wales and free '
             'for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides '
             'free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and '
             "people\\'s own homes.  Ministers in England have promised the "
             'system will change. New plans are due to be published by the '
             'summer of 2018.  ## 10\\. Much more is spent on front-line '
             'healthcare than social care  But, as yet, no part of the UK has '
             'cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care '
             'service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done?  Would '
             'you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service '
             'to a national institution and the other to local councils? Would '
             'you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the '
             'other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other?  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Would you build more than '
             '200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when '
             'the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses '
             'that need care rather than medical intervention?  But as that is '
             'the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are '
             'falling back on a typical British trait - making do.   '

             'life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now.  This is '
             'something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a '
             'significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of '
             'people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death '
             'sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade '
             'or more.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  But this '
             'progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing '
             'number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease '
             'and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what '
             'patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people '
             'will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have '
             'two.  ## 5\\. Care for older people costs much more  The average '
             '65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average '
             '30-year- old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as '
             'much.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  As the numbers '
             'continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded '
             'by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently '
             'considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at £20m '
             'each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost '
             "more than this.  Then there\\'s obesity. A third of adults are "
             'so overweight they are risking their health significantly.  All '
             'this contributes to what health economists call health inflation '
             '- the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal '
             'rise in the cost of living across the economy.  This is why '
             'health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of '
             'government spending.  Over the years this has been achievable '
             'through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more '
             'money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as '
             'defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share '
             'of the public purse.  ## 6\\. Increases in NHS spending have '
             'slowed  But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over '
             'the years governments have varied the amount they were willing '
             'or able to give.  Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average '
             'annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under '
             'Blair and Brown this was considerably higher.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  As you can see the period between 2010 and '
             '2015 saw the tightest financial settlement.  The following two '
             'years were a little more generous, but that average is likely to '
             'drop a little over the rest of the parliament under current '
             'spending plans.  So ministers in England are right to say they '
             "are increasing funding - it\\'s been frozen in Wales and "
             "Scotland - but it\\'s just that it doesn\\'t compare favourably "
             'with what the NHS has traditionally got.  Indeed, the Institute '
             'for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the 10 years to 2020, '
             'the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to '
             'keep pace with the ageing and growing population.  ## 7\\. The '
             'UK spends a lower proportion on health than other EU countries  '
             'But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few '
             'billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other '
             'European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a '
             'proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the '
             'economy.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  The result, as you would expect, '
             'is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the '
             'big spenders.  But a number of these countries achieve that by '
             'taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by '
             'Ipsos MORI for the BBC last year is anything to go by, they are '
             'pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would '
             "support National Insurance going up.  Nor does it seem there\\'s "
             'appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against '
             'charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like '
             'some of our European neighbours do.  But even if more money was '
             'spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight '
             'improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and '
             'that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people '
             'wanting to work in key posts.  Trainee posts for GPs are being '
             'increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all.  There also remain '
             'big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for '
             '21st Century healthcare.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  The NHS is still '
             'centred on the network of district general hospitals that '
             'emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s.  But in '
             'an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, '
             'what they really need is support in the community.  The problem '
             "is there\\'s a serious shortage of this. The number of district "
             'nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, '
             'while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly '
             'difficult.  ## 8\\. Demand for A&E is rising  The result is that '
             'people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have '
             'risen by over 40% in 13 years.  \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  Not all of '
             'this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they '
             'tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of '
             'hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population '
             'with a long-term condition.  There are attempts to change this '
             'by placing more emphasis on care outside hospital.  NHS England '
             'chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to '
             'create more integrated care, which involves hospital services '
             'working more closely with their local community teams. Similar '
             'moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  '
             'There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more '
             'active, eat better diets and drink less.  ## 9\\. Fewer older '
             'people are getting help with social care  But perhaps the '
             'biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day '
             'centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and '
             'dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final '
             'years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and '
             'living independently - and out of hospital.  In an era when the '
             'population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting '
             'help from the state.  However, the opposite is true. In England '
             'over the past four years for which we have data, the number of '
             'older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is '
             'large numbers going without care or having to pay for it '
             'themselves.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  The other '
             'parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this '
             'respect - home care is capped at £70 a week in Wales and free '
             'for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides '
             'free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and '
             "people\\'s own homes.  Ministers in England have promised the "
             'system will change. New plans are due to be published by the '
             'summer of 2018.  ## 10\\. Much more is spent on front-line '
             'healthcare than social care  But, as yet, no part of the UK has '
             'cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care '
             'service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done?  Would '
             'you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service '
             'to a national institution and the other to local councils? Would '
             'you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the '
             'other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other?  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Would you build more than '
             '200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when '
             'the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses '
             'that need care rather than medical intervention?  But as that is '
             'the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are '
             'falling back on a typical British trait - making do.   '

             'on the latest data on performance against four NHS waiting-time '
             'measures:  \\n    * A&E treatment \\n    * Cancer care \\n    * '
             'Planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements '
             '\\n    * Access to psychological treatment such as counselling '
             '\\n  This data is currently published either monthly or '
             'quarterly depending on where you live in the UK, and there are '
             'differences between how the targets are measured in each part of '
             'the UK. See below for data sources.  ## The A&E target  The way '
             'the A&E target is measured is almost identical. In each case '
             'services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat '
             'and discharge or admit or transfer a patient.  They are all '
             'expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately '
             'Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved. '
             'There are also slight differences in the way the start time is '
             'measured.  ## The cancer target  There are similarities in the '
             'way cancer care is measured. Each expects patients to be treated '
             'within 62 days of an urgent referral.  In Scotland this can be '
             'following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.  '
             'Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route. So '
             'for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the '
             'area to focus on as this is the most common route. Again the '
             'thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.  ## The '
             'planned operations and care target  The one that varies the most '
             'is for planned hospital care, which is also known as '
             'non-emergency treatment.  In England, Wales and Scotland the '
             'target measures the point at which you get a referral from your '
             'GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole '
             'patient journey.  In Scotland and England services have 18 '
             'weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.  Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland '
             'there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient '
             'journey. The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the '
             'decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when '
             'that treatment starts. It therefore does not include the tests '
             'and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks '
             'or even months. Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to '
             'achieve this target.  The thresholds vary too. None is expected '
             'to achieve these goals 100% of the time. In Northern Ireland '
             'services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in '
             'Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.  ## The '
             'mental health therapy target  There is also quite a wide '
             'variation in how access to mental health therapy is measured.  '
             'These therapies cover psychological treatments, such as '
             'counselling, for conditions such as depression, anxiety and '
             'stress.  In England and Scotland access is measured in the time '
             'it takes from getting a referral to that treatment getting under '
             'way.  Scotland publishes a combined figure for mental health for '
             'the three Islands boards - Shetland, Orkney and Western Isles - '
             'this is because the numbers being referred are relatively '
             'small.  In Wales the data only covers part of that patient '
             'journey - from when it is definitely decided treatment is '
             'needed, which is normally one-stage after a referral from a GP.  '
             'Northern Ireland does not measure access to mental health '
             'support outside of hospitals.  ## How local is defined  In '
             'England data is provided down to individual hospital trust '
             'level, some of these run more than one hospital. The BBC has '
             "excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children\\'s care, "
             "women\\'s services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused "
             'on the 131 general hospital trusts - what most people would '
             'consider their local service.  However, mental health therapy '
             'services fall outside the control of hospitals and are organised '
             'by local NHS organisations called clinical commissioning groups '
             '(CCGs).  Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board '
             'level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland. They '
             'are in charge of services for a region or large city and often '
             'run more than one hospital alongside community services.  We '
             'have chosen these boards because while some data is provided '
             'down to individual hospital level it is not done across all four '
             'targets.  ## How far back performance is tracked  The BBC has '
             'tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target '
             'was set or to when the records allow.  When a target has been '
             'missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.  When '
             'targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month '
             'they were last hit.  The targets where it has not been possible '
             'to go back five years:  \\n    * in England for mental health '
             'therapy, the target of 75% was set in 2015 but only published in '
             'quarterly data from April 2016 \\n    * in Scotland for A&E as '
             'the target threshold was reduced from 98% to 95% in October '
             '2014. And for mental health the target of 90% was set in '
             'December 2014 \\n    * in Northern Ireland for planned '
             'operations and care because its 13-week target threshold of 55% '
             'was set only in April 2016 \\n    * in Wales the mental health '
             'target of 80% started in November 2015 \\n  ## The full list of '
             'dates from which the performance of local services is available '
             'are:  For England:  A&E: June 2010  Cancer: January 2009  '

             'on the latest data on performance against four NHS waiting-time '
             'measures:  \\n    * A&E treatment \\n    * Cancer care \\n    * '
             'Planned operations and care, such as knee and hip replacements '
             '\\n    * Access to psychological treatment such as counselling '
             '\\n  This data is currently published either monthly or '
             'quarterly depending on where you live in the UK, and there are '
             'differences between how the targets are measured in each part of '
             'the UK. See below for data sources.  ## The A&E target  The way '
             'the A&E target is measured is almost identical. In each case '
             'services across the UK are given four hours in which to treat '
             'and discharge or admit or transfer a patient.  They are all '
             'expected to do that in 95% of cases, although ultimately '
             'Scotland wants it services to get to 98% once 95% is achieved. '
             'There are also slight differences in the way the start time is '
             'measured.  ## The cancer target  There are similarities in the '
             'way cancer care is measured. Each expects patients to be treated '
             'within 62 days of an urgent referral.  In Scotland this can be '
             'following a GP or A&E referral or following a screening test.  '
             'Elsewhere it is broken down individually by referral route. So '
             'for the rest of the UK the BBC has chosen GP referral as the '
             'area to focus on as this is the most common route. Again the '
             'thresholds services are expected to achieve vary.  ## The '
             'planned operations and care target  The one that varies the most '
             'is for planned hospital care, which is also known as '
             'non-emergency treatment.  In England, Wales and Scotland the '
             'target measures the point at which you get a referral from your '
             'GP to the point when your treatment starts - in effect the whole '
             'patient journey.  In Scotland and England services have 18 '
             'weeks, in Wales it is 26 weeks.  Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland '
             'there are a range of targets for different parts of the patient '
             'journey. The BBC has chosen the last part, from when the '
             'decision is taken to admit the patient for treatment to when '
             'that treatment starts. It therefore does not include the tests '
             'and appointments that follow a GP referral, which can take weeks '
             'or even months. Services in Northern Ireland have 13 weeks to '
             'achieve this target.  The thresholds vary too. None is expected '
             'to achieve these goals 100% of the time. In Northern Ireland '
             'services have to achieve the target in 55% of cases, whereas in '
             'Wales it is 95%, in England 92%, and in Scotland 90%.  ## The '
             'mental health therapy target  There is also quite a wide '
             'variation in how access to mental health therapy is measured.  '
             'These therapies cover psychological treatments, such as '
             'counselling, for conditions such as depression, anxiety and '
             'stress.  In England and Scotland access is measured in the time '
             'it takes from getting a referral to that treatment getting under '
             'way.  Scotland publishes a combined figure for mental health for '
             'the three Islands boards - Shetland, Orkney and Western Isles - '
             'this is because the numbers being referred are relatively '
             'small.  In Wales the data only covers part of that patient '
             'journey - from when it is definitely decided treatment is '
             'needed, which is normally one-stage after a referral from a GP.  '
             'Northern Ireland does not measure access to mental health '
             'support outside of hospitals.  ## How local is defined  In '
             'England data is provided down to individual hospital trust '
             'level, some of these run more than one hospital. The BBC has '
             "excluded specialist trusts for cancer, children\\'s care, "
             "women\\'s services and orthopaedic treatment and instead focused "
             'on the 131 general hospital trusts - what most people would '
             'consider their local service.  However, mental health therapy '
             'services fall outside the control of hospitals and are organised '
             'by local NHS organisations called clinical commissioning groups '
             '(CCGs).  Elsewhere performance is broken down to health board '
             'level, known as health and care trusts in Northern Ireland. They '
             'are in charge of services for a region or large city and often '
             'run more than one hospital alongside community services.  We '
             'have chosen these boards because while some data is provided '
             'down to individual hospital level it is not done across all four '
             'targets.  ## How far back performance is tracked  The BBC has '
             'tracked back performance to the point at which the latest target '
             'was set or to when the records allow.  When a target has been '
             'missed for five years, we have just labelled it as that.  When '
             'targets have been hit more recently, we have provided the month '
             'they were last hit.  The targets where it has not been possible '
             'to go back five years:  \\n    * in England for mental health '
             'therapy, the target of 75% was set in 2015 but only published in '
             'quarterly data from April 2016 \\n    * in Scotland for A&E as '
             'the target threshold was reduced from 98% to 95% in October '
             '2014. And for mental health the target of 90% was set in '
             'December 2014 \\n    * in Northern Ireland for planned '
             'operations and care because its 13-week target threshold of 55% '
             'was set only in April 2016 \\n    * in Wales the mental health '
             'target of 80% started in November 2015 \\n  ## The full list of '
             'dates from which the performance of local services is available '
             'are:  For England:  A&E: June 2010  Cancer: January 2009  '

             'For Wales:  A&E: October 2009  Cancer: October-December 2009  '
             'Planned operations: September 2011  Mental health: November '

             '2009  Planned operations: April-June 2016  ## How the data is '
             'displayed  The bar charts displayed for each measure represent '
             'the data for each trust or board which we are tracking in each '
             'nation. As most of the data is in a fairly narrow range, we have '
             'truncated the vertical y-axis so that the detail can be seen '
             'more clearly. In the example below, the axis starts at 70%, in '
             'other charts it varies in accordance with the data.  \\n \\n \\n '

             'Sexual health services in England are "at a tipping point", '
             'according to local councils in England, who say visits to '
             'clinics have increased while funding has been cut.  The Local '
             'Government Association warns that patients could face longer '
             'waiting times.  But the latest data shows diagnoses of sexually '
             'transmitted infections (STIs) have fallen in the past year.  The '
             'government said more than £16bn was being invested in public '
             'health.  Responsibility for public health in England has rested '
             'with local councils since 2013 - but the Local Government '
             'Association says it has not been given adequate resources to run '
             'proper services.  It points to budget cuts of more than £500m - '
             'nearly 10% - over the past two years.  The overall public health '
             'budget is £3.4bn for 2017-18 and councils spend around £600m a '
             'year on sexual health services.  With the number of new '
             'attendances at sexual health clinics up by around 25% - from '
             '1,941,801 in 2012 to 2,456,779 in 2016 - councils say they are '
             'facing particular pressure.  ## Good news  However, there is '
             'some positive news - new diagnoses of STIs, such as gonorrhea, '
             'chlamydia and genital warts, fell by 4% from 2015-16.  Chlamydia '
             'is the most common STI in the UK and is easily passed on during '
             'sex. It can be tested for by providing a urine sample or a '
             'vaginal swab.  Council leaders say it is good news more people '
             'are taking responsibility for their sexual health, but they warn '
             'that higher numbers are turning up at clinics and putting a '
             'strain on resources.  The LGA says patients could face a poorer '
             'quality service and wait longer for tests and treatment if '
             'additional funding is not provided.  Cllr Izzi Seccombe, '
             'chairman of the LGA\\\'s Community Wellbeing Board, said: "The '
             'reduction in public health funding could also compound problems '
             "further and impact on councils\\' ability to meet demand and "
             'respond to unforeseen outbreaks."  ## \\\'Necessary '
             'resources\\\'  She added: "It is obviously good news that '
             'diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections are down, but '
             'sexual health services are now reaching a tipping point where it '
             'will be extremely challenging to maintain this progress.  "Once '
             'again this is an example of councils inheriting the '
             'responsibility of public health when it was transferred from the '
             'NHS in 2013, but without the necessary resources to deliver '

             'man in the UK who caught the world\\\'s "worst-ever" case of '
             'super-gonorrhoea has been cured.  Sexual health doctors say he '
             'was "very lucky" and the case was a "major wake- up call for '
             'everybody".  He picked up the superbug having sex with a woman '
             'in South East Asia, despite having a British partner.  It was '
             'the first-ever case of the infection being incurable with first '
             'choice antibiotics, but now two similar cases have been reported '
             'in Australia.  The original case came to light last month and '
             'was linked to travel earlier in the year.  The main antibiotic '
             'treatment - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone - '
             'failed to treat the disease.  A detailed analysis of his '
             'infection suggested one last antibiotic might work and he has '
             'since been treated with ertapenem.  Dr Gwenda Hughes, the head '
             'of sexually-transmitted infections at Public Health England, '
             'said: "We are pleased to report that the case of multi-drug '
             'resistant gonorrhoea has been successfully treated."  The public '
             'health body launched an investigation to track down any further '
             'cases - including in his British partner - but says the superbug '
             'has not spread in the UK.  Discussions between Public Health '
             'England, the World Health Organization and the European Centres '
             'for Disease Control agreed this was the most serious case of '
             'antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea ever detected.  But now two '
             '"similar" cases have been discovered in Australia. One also had '
             'sex in South East Asia, the other reported no foreign travel.  '
             'Dr Hughes said they will be "challenging" to treat and were a '
             '"timely reminder" to everyone that super-gonorrhoea is likely to '
             'be more common in the future.  * * *  ## What is gonorrhoea?  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n CAVALLINI '
             'JAMES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\\n \\n \\n \\n  The disease is '
             'caused by the bacterium _Neisseria gonorrhoeae._  The infection '
             'is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.  Symptoms '
             'can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual '
             'organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.  '
             'However, vaginal and rectal infections often have no symptoms.  '
             'An untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic '
             'inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during '
             'pregnancy.  * * *  Dr Olwen Williams, the president of the '
             'British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said the case was '
             'a "major wake-up call for everybody".  She told the BBC: "He was '
             'very lucky that he still had one remaining antibiotic that was '
             'used successfully.  "Our concern is in the future there might be '
             'no antimicrobials that will work."  She said people needed to be '
             'aware that the risk of picking up superbugs is higher in '
             'countries that use antibiotics less carefully.  Antibiotics are '
             'available to buy over the counter in many countries around the '
             'world, unlike in the UK where a prescription from a doctor is '
             'needed.  It means the drugs are likely to be overused, driving '
             'up rates of resistance.  Dr Williams said: "We have to be aware '
             'when we travel that is potentially what we pick up.  "If you '
             'have unsafe sex anywhere in the world, get checked out when you '
             'come back before having sex with other partners."  She also '
             'warned cuts to sexual health services were hitting "in a world '
             'where have to tackle multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea and rising '
             'incidence of syphilis" and that was a "significant concern".  '

             'treatment - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone - '
             'failed to treat the disease.  A detailed analysis of his '
             'infection suggested one last antibiotic might work and he has '
             'since been treated with ertapenem.  Dr Gwenda Hughes, the head '
             'of sexually-transmitted infections at Public Health England, '
             'said: "We are pleased to report that the case of multi-drug '
             'resistant gonorrhoea has been successfully treated."  The public '
             'health body launched an investigation to track down any further '
             'cases - including in his British partner - but says the superbug '
             'has not spread in the UK.  Discussions between Public Health '
             'England, the World Health Organization and the European Centres '
             'for Disease Control agreed this was the most serious case of '
             'antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea ever detected.  But now two '
             '"similar" cases have been discovered in Australia. One also had '
             'sex in South East Asia, the other reported no foreign travel.  '
             'Dr Hughes said they will be "challenging" to treat and were a '
             '"timely reminder" to everyone that super-gonorrhoea is likely to '
             'be more common in the future.  * * *  ## What is gonorrhoea?  '

             'JAMES/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\\n \\n \\n \\n  The disease is '
             'caused by the bacterium _Neisseria gonorrhoeae._  The infection '
             'is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.  Symptoms '
             'can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual '
             'organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.  '
             'However, vaginal and rectal infections often have no symptoms.  '
             'An untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic '
             'inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during '
             'pregnancy.  * * *  Dr Olwen Williams, the president of the '
             'British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said the case was '
             'a "major wake-up call for everybody".  She told the BBC: "He was '
             'very lucky that he still had one remaining antibiotic that was '
             'used successfully.  "Our concern is in the future there might be '
             'no antimicrobials that will work."  She said people needed to be '
             'aware that the risk of picking up superbugs is higher in '
             'countries that use antibiotics less carefully.  Antibiotics are '
             'available to buy over the counter in many countries around the '
             'world, unlike in the UK where a prescription from a doctor is '
             'needed.  It means the drugs are likely to be overused, driving '
             'up rates of resistance.  Dr Williams said: "We have to be aware '
             'when we travel that is potentially what we pick up.  "If you '
             'have unsafe sex anywhere in the world, get checked out when you '
             'come back before having sex with other partners."  She also '
             'warned cuts to sexual health services were hitting "in a world '
             'where have to tackle multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea and rising '
             'incidence of syphilis" and that was a "significant concern".  '

             'Jimmy Isaacs, 28, discovered he had been infected with HIV by a '
             'former partner nearly three years ago.  He takes three drugs '
             'once a day at 18:00 and will continue to do so for the rest of '
             'his life.  "My health is absolutely fine. I\\\'m eating '

             "impact on my job and hasn\\'t impacted on my social life "
             'either."  Although it took two changes of medication to find the '
             'right combination for him, he says he now has no side effects at '
             'all.  "I had heard a lot of bad stories about the drugs back in '
             "the \\'90s - but when I did some research, I realised the drugs "
             'had completely changed."  Not all his employers have been '
             'supportive since his diagnosis and he says that is down to '
             'ignorance.  His current employer has given him time off to tour '

             'prevention and treatment.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             'The researchers looked at 88,500 people with HIV from Europe and '
             'North America who had been involved in 18 studies.  They based '
             'their life-expectancy predictions on death rates during the '
             'first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was '
             'started.  They found that fewer people who started treatment '
             'between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with '
             'those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007.  The expected '
             'age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral '
             'therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the '
             'first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general '
             'population.  ## What is antiretroviral therapy?  \\n \\n \\n '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Antiretroviral therapy combines '
             'three or more drugs which stop the HIV virus from progressing\\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  \\n    * First used in 1996, it involves a '
             'combination of three or more drugs that stop the HIV virus from '
             'replicating \\n    * This means damage to the immune system '
             'caused by HIV can be prevented and it stops the disease '
             'spreading to others \\n    * More recent drugs are even more '
             'efficient and have fewer side effects \\n    * The World Health '
             'Organization recommends that antiretroviral therapy is started '
             'as soon as possible after diagnosis  \\n  Dr Michael Brady, '
             'medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study '
             'showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV '
             'epidemic in the 1980s.  But he said it also meant people aged '
             'over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with '
             'HIV.  "As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare '
             "systems simply aren\\'t ready to support the increasing numbers "
             'of people growing older with HIV.  "We need a new model of care '
             'to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, '
             'and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV '
             "and ageing, so that we\\'re ready to help older people live well "
             'in later life," he said.  ## \\\'Medical achievement\\\'  Prof '
             'Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: '
             '"It\\\'s a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that '
             'once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and '
             'that patients with HIV are living significantly longer.  "We '
             'hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing '
             'any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that '
             'patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without '
             'experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in '
             'countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance."  '
             'She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV '
             'testing by GPs.  The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV '
             'has fallen steadily over the past 20 years.  But one in eight '
             'people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed.  \\n \\n '

             'first three years of follow-up after drug treatment was '
             'started.  They found that fewer people who started treatment '
             'between 2008 and 2010 died during this period compared with '
             'those who began treatment between 1996 and 2007.  The expected '
             'age at death of a 20-year-old patient starting antiretroviral '
             'therapy (ART) after 2008, with a low viral load and after the '
             'first year of treatment, was 78 years - similar to the general '

             '\\n \\n \\n  \\n    * First used in 1996, it involves a '
             'combination of three or more drugs that stop the HIV virus from '
             'replicating \\n    * This means damage to the immune system '
             'caused by HIV can be prevented and it stops the disease '
             'spreading to others \\n    * More recent drugs are even more '
             'efficient and have fewer side effects \\n    * The World Health '
             'Organization recommends that antiretroviral therapy is started '
             'as soon as possible after diagnosis  \\n  Dr Michael Brady, '
             'medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said the study '
             'showed how much things had changed since the start of the HIV '
             'epidemic in the 1980s.  But he said it also meant people aged '
             'over 50 now represented one in three of all those living with '
             'HIV.  "As it stands, the healthcare, social care and welfare '
             "systems simply aren\\'t ready to support the increasing numbers "
             'of people growing older with HIV.  "We need a new model of care '
             'to better integrate primary care with HIV specialist services, '
             'and we need a major shift in awareness and training around HIV '
             "and ageing, so that we\\'re ready to help older people live well "
             'in later life," he said.  ## \\\'Medical achievement\\\'  Prof '
             'Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, said: '
             '"It\\\'s a tremendous medical achievement that an infection that '
             'once had such a terrible prognosis is now so manageable, and '
             'that patients with HIV are living significantly longer.  "We '
             'hope the results of this study go a long way to finally removing '
             'any remaining stigma associated with HIV, and ensuring that '
             'patients with HIV can live long and healthy lives without '
             'experiencing difficulties in gaining employment and - in '
             'countries where it is necessary - obtaining medical insurance."  '
             'She said steps were being taken to increase appropriate HIV '
             'testing by GPs.  The proportion of people with undiagnosed HIV '
             'has fallen steadily over the past 20 years.  But one in eight '
             'people with HIV is still thought to remain undiagnosed.  \\n \\n '

             'diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 '
             'billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to '
             'the planet.  Scientists have been trying to figure out how we '
             'are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come.  '
             'Their answer - "the planetary health diet" - does not completely '
             'banish meat and dairy.  But it is recommending we get most of '
             'our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) '
             'instead.  Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on '
             'to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat.  '
             '## What changes am I going to have to make?  If you eat meat '
             "every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you\\'re "
             "looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that\\'s "
             'your lot.  You can still have a couple of portions of fish and '
             'the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of '
             'your protein will need to come from. The researchers are '
             'recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day '
             "instead.  There\\'s also a major push on all fruit and veg, "
             'which should make up half of every plate of food we eat.  '
             'Although there\\\'s a cull on "starchy vegetables" such as the '
             'humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa.  ## So '
             'what is the diet in detail?  If you served it all up this is '

             '\\n    6. \\n **Carbs** \\- whole grains like bread and rice '

             '"Whether it\\\'s a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn\\\'t have to '

             'Taxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers '
             'say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets.  ## Who '
             'came up with this?  A group of 37 scientists from around the '

             'change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their '
             'findings which have been published in the Lancet.  ## Why do we '
             'need a diet for 10 billion people?  The world population reached '
             "seven billion in 2011 and it\\'s now around 7.7 billion. That "
             'figure is expected to reach 10 billion around 2050 and will keep '
             'on climbing.  ## Will it save lives?  The researchers say the '
             'diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year.  That '
             'number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy '
             'diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are '

             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  The use of land for '
             'growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of '
             "global greenhouse gas emissions. That\\'s about the same as from "
             'electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all '
             'the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet.  When you look '
             "more closely at the food sector\\'s environmental impact, you "
             'can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, '
             'livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced '
             'greenhouse gas emissions.  When it comes to other warming gases, '
             'agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane '
             'and nitrous oxide emissions.  Agriculture is also a significant '
             'source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of '
             'fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization '
             '(WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide.  Similarly when it '
             'comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the '
             'biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for '
             'irrigation.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## So will '
             "this diet save the planet?  The researchers\\' aim was to feed "
             'more people while:  \\n    * minimising greenhouse gas emissions '
             '\\n    * preventing any species going extinct \\n    * having no '

             'However, just changing diets is nowhere near enough.  To make '
             'the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an '
             'increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland.  ## '
             'Why isn\\\'t meat being banned?  "If we were just minimising '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  A '
             'diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 '
             'billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to '
             'the planet.  Scientists have been trying to figure out how we '
             'are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come.  '
             'Their answer - "the planetary health diet" - does not completely '
             'banish meat and dairy.  But it is recommending we get most of '
             'our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) '
             'instead.  Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on '
             'to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat.  '
             '## What changes am I going to have to make?  If you eat meat '
             "every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you\\'re "
             "looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that\\'s "
             'your lot.  You can still have a couple of portions of fish and '
             'the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of '
             'your protein will need to come from. The researchers are '
             'recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day '
             "instead.  There\\'s also a major push on all fruit and veg, "
             'which should make up half of every plate of food we eat.  '
             'Although there\\\'s a cull on "starchy vegetables" such as the '
             'humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa.  ## So '
             'what is the diet in detail?  If you served it all up this is '
             'what you would be allowed each day:  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '

             '**Meat** \\- 14g a day of red meat and 29g a day of chicken  '
             '\\n    6. \\n **Carbs** \\- whole grains like bread and rice '
             '232g a day and 50g a day of starchy vegetables \\n    7. \\n '
             '**Dairy** \\- 250g - the equivalent of one glass of milk  \\n    '
             '8. \\n **Vegetables** -(300g) and fruit (200g)  \\n  The diet '
             'has room for 31g of **sugar** and about 50g worth of **oils** '

             'ambulance this winter has faced a delay of more than 30 minutes '
             'on arrival, BBC analysis shows.  Patients are meant to be handed '
             'over to staff within 15 minutes, but more than 75,000 have '
             'waited at least twice as long as that in England.  Some of the '
             'worst waits had lasted up to five hours, ambulance crews said.  '

             'thought was having a stroke, when she was caught in a queue '
             'outside Broomfield Hospital in Essex this week.  "We weren\\\'t '
             'moving. We weren\\\'t going anywhere," she said.  \\n \\n \\n '

             'Image caption\\n \\n Ambulances queuing this week outside '
             'Broomfield Hospital in Essex\\n \\n \\n \\n  Her mother kept '
             'falling in and out of consciousness, while she and her sister '
             'tried to keep her spirits up.  Ambulances continued arriving, '
             'making them scared they would be bumped for more urgent cases.  '
             '"It\\\'s just gobsmacking," Leah said.  She said it was too soon '
             "to know what affect the delay had had on her mother\\'s health.  "
             '"The staff are doing all they can. There just aren\\\'t the '
             'funds for the beds," she said.  Dr Ellen Makings, medical '
             'director at Mid Essex Services NHS Trust, said she was '
             '"extremely sorry" for the waits experienced on that day.  "Our '
             'staff were working extremely hard to ensure that all patients '
             'were safe at all times.  "Whilst it was far from ideal for this '
             'patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared '
             'for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a '
             'qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of '
             'arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at '
             'one hour 50 minutes."  She added once Leah\\\'s mother had been '
             'assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. '
             'Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient '
             'presents with stroke-like symptoms but has not actually had '
             'one.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College '
             'of Emergency Medicine, said the problems being seen were "not '
             'surprising".  "A&E units are over-crowded, so staff just cannot '
             'take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay '
             'with them.  "It means they face longer delays for all the '
             'assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing '
             'we can do about it."  Figures from Public Health England show '
             'there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for '
             'confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses '
             'said this was contributing to pressure on the NHS.  \\n  \\n  '

             'waited at least twice as long as that in England.  Some of the '

             'were safe at all times.  "Whilst it was far from ideal for this '
             'patient to have an extended stay in the ambulance she was cared '
             'for throughout by experienced paramedics and was assessed by a '
             'qualified emergency department sister within 30 minutes of '
             'arrival, and then again by an emergency department consultant at '
             'one hour 50 minutes."  She added once Leah\\\'s mother had been '
             'assessed and had a scan it emerged she had not had a stroke. '
             'Instead she was diagnosed with a stroke mimic, where a patient '

             'take care of these patients and ambulance crews have to stay '
             'with them.  "It means they face longer delays for all the '
             'assessments they should get. It is a risk, but there is nothing '
             'we can do about it."  Figures from Public Health England show '
             'there was a sharp rise in hospital admissions in England for '
             'confirmed flu cases in the last week of December, and PHE bosses '

             "\\n \\n  It\\'s January, which means you may have stood on the "
             'scales and decided to go on a diet. But what sort?  For many '
             'years, low-carb diets have been in fashion - based on the belief '
             'that eating lots of carbohydrates, particularly in the form of '
             'sugary treats such as white bread, rice or pasta, is bad for '
             'your waist and for your blood-sugar control.  The reasoning is '
             'that if you eat lots of carbohydrates and sugars, particularly '
             'the sort without fibre that get quickly absorbed, they will '
             'rapidly push up your blood glucose (sugar) levels.  Unless you '
             'burn this glucose off by doing exercise, your pancreas will pump '
             'out lots of the hormone insulin to bring these levels back down '
             'to normal.  It does this by storing the excess sugar from the '
             'carbs as fat. Too much stored fat, particularly visceral fat '
             '(inside the abdomen) can lead to serious health problems such as '
             'type-2 diabetes.  As well as concern about the amount of carbs '
             "we eat, people also worry about when they get eaten.  It\\'s "
             'widely believed, for example, that eating carbs in the evening '
             "is worse for you than having them for breakfast.  That\\'s "
             'because first thing in the morning your body is raring to go and '
             'should soon burn up the glucose released from the carbs. When '
             'you eat late at night your body is preparing to sleep, so the '
             "body should take longer to clear it.  That\\'s the theory. But "
             'is it really true?  ## Morning v evening carbs  On Trust Me '
             "I\\'m a Doctor, with the help of Dr Adam Collins, from the "
             'University of Surrey, we set up a small study.  We recruited '
             'healthy volunteers to see how well their bodies coped with '
             'eating most of their carbs in the morning, or in the evening.  '
             "We also wanted to see if the volunteers\\' bodies would adapt "
             'over time.  All of our volunteers were asked to eat a fixed '
             'amount of carbs every day; things such as vegetables, bread and '
             'pasta.  For the first five days they were asked to eat most of '
             'their carb allowance for breakfast, leaving only a small amount '
             'for dinner time.  Then they had five days of normal eating '
             'before switching to low-carb breakfasts and high-carb dinners '
             'for a final five days.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## '
             "More from Trust Me I\\'m a Doctor:  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n "
             "\\n \\n  Dr Collins\\'s team was monitoring their blood-glucose "
             'levels throughout. So what did he think he would find?  "It\\\'s '
             'always made sense to me that we process carbs better if we have '
             'a whole day of activity ahead," he said.  "So, I expect having '
             'most of their carbs at breakfast will be easier for their bodies '
             'to cope with.  "But we don\\\'t really know what happens if you '
             'regularly follow an evening- carbs diet.  "There\\\'s never been '
             "a study like this before, and as a scientist I\\'m excited to "
             'see what happens"  So what did we find?  Well, there was a clear '
             "winner. And it wasn\\'t the one I was expecting.  \\n \\n \\n "
             '\\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             'When the researchers tested the volunteers on the day after a '
             'run of high-carb breakfasts and low-carb dinners, they found '
             'their average blood glucose response was 15.9 units.  This was '
             'roughly as predicted.  But when they did the same tests after '
             'five days of low-carb breakfasts and high-carb dinners?  '
             'Remarkably, their average glucose response went down to 10.4 '
             'units, which was considerably lower than we were expecting.  So '
             'what happened? Well, it could be that what matters is not so '
             'much when you eat your carbs but the length of the carbs-free '
             '"fasting" period that precedes your meal.  If you\\\'ve had a '
             'big gap since your last carb-rich meal, your body will be more '
             'ready to deal with it.  That happens naturally in the mornings '

             "\\n \\n  It\\'s January, which means you may have stood on the "
             'scales and decided to go on a diet. But what sort?  For many '
             'years, low-carb diets have been in fashion - based on the belief '
             'that eating lots of carbohydrates, particularly in the form of '
             'sugary treats such as white bread, rice or pasta, is bad for '
             'your waist and for your blood-sugar control.  The reasoning is '
             'that if you eat lots of carbohydrates and sugars, particularly '
             'the sort without fibre that get quickly absorbed, they will '
             'rapidly push up your blood glucose (sugar) levels.  Unless you '
             'burn this glucose off by doing exercise, your pancreas will pump '
             'out lots of the hormone insulin to bring these levels back down '
             'to normal.  It does this by storing the excess sugar from the '
             'carbs as fat. Too much stored fat, particularly visceral fat '
             '(inside the abdomen) can lead to serious health problems such as '
             'type-2 diabetes.  As well as concern about the amount of carbs '
             "we eat, people also worry about when they get eaten.  It\\'s "
             'widely believed, for example, that eating carbs in the evening '
             "is worse for you than having them for breakfast.  That\\'s "
             'because first thing in the morning your body is raring to go and '
             'should soon burn up the glucose released from the carbs. When '
             'you eat late at night your body is preparing to sleep, so the '
             "body should take longer to clear it.  That\\'s the theory. But "
             'is it really true?  ## Morning v evening carbs  On Trust Me '
             "I\\'m a Doctor, with the help of Dr Adam Collins, from the "
             'University of Surrey, we set up a small study.  We recruited '
             'healthy volunteers to see how well their bodies coped with '
             'eating most of their carbs in the morning, or in the evening.  '
             "We also wanted to see if the volunteers\\' bodies would adapt "
             'over time.  All of our volunteers were asked to eat a fixed '
             'amount of carbs every day; things such as vegetables, bread and '
             'pasta.  For the first five days they were asked to eat most of '
             'their carb allowance for breakfast, leaving only a small amount '
             'for dinner time.  Then they had five days of normal eating '
             'before switching to low-carb breakfasts and high-carb dinners '
             'for a final five days.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## '
             "More from Trust Me I\\'m a Doctor:  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n "
             "\\n \\n  Dr Collins\\'s team was monitoring their blood-glucose "
             'levels throughout. So what did he think he would find?  "It\\\'s '
             'always made sense to me that we process carbs better if we have '
             'a whole day of activity ahead," he said.  "So, I expect having '
             'most of their carbs at breakfast will be easier for their bodies '
             'to cope with.  "But we don\\\'t really know what happens if you '
             'regularly follow an evening- carbs diet.  "There\\\'s never been '
             "a study like this before, and as a scientist I\\'m excited to "
             'see what happens"  So what did we find?  Well, there was a clear '
             "winner. And it wasn\\'t the one I was expecting.  \\n \\n \\n "
             '\\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             'When the researchers tested the volunteers on the day after a '
             'run of high-carb breakfasts and low-carb dinners, they found '
             'their average blood glucose response was 15.9 units.  This was '
             'roughly as predicted.  But when they did the same tests after '
             'five days of low-carb breakfasts and high-carb dinners?  '
             'Remarkably, their average glucose response went down to 10.4 '
             'units, which was considerably lower than we were expecting.  So '
             'what happened? Well, it could be that what matters is not so '
             'much when you eat your carbs but the length of the carbs-free '
             '"fasting" period that precedes your meal.  If you\\\'ve had a '
             'big gap since your last carb-rich meal, your body will be more '
             'ready to deal with it.  That happens naturally in the mornings '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  We '
             'all know that sugary, fizzy drinks are full of calories - with '
             'the equivalent of about seven teaspoons of sugar in a standard '
             'can of cola.  But is it only the sugar in the drink that swells '
             'our waists, or could it also be the bubbles?  In a recent study '
             'done last year at Birzeit University in the Palestinian '
             'territories, researchers took a group of male rats and gave them '
             'either a fizzy sugary drink, a flat sugary drink or tap water to '
             'consume.  They found that the rats who regularly drank the gassy '
             'sugary drink put on more weight at a much faster rate than rats '
             'given either flat sugary liquids or tap water.  When they took '
             'blood samples, they found that the rats drinking fizz had much '
             'higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin, which could explain '
             'the weight gain.  ## Cheese sandwich test  It was such an '
             "interesting study that the BBC\\'s Trust Me I\\'m a Doctor team "
             'thought we should do a similar experiment, but with a mix of '
             'human volunteers.  With the help of Dr James Brown from Aston '
             'University in Birmingham we recruited a group of healthy '
             'volunteers.  Rather cunningly, we decided not to tell our '
             "volunteers what the experiment was really about as we didn\\'t "
             'want that knowledge to affect the results.  So instead of '
             'telling them it was mainly about bubbles, we said it was about '
             'measuring the impact of sugary drinks on appetite - which was '
             'partly true.  At the start of the experiment, our volunteers '
             'arrived at the lab after having gone 10 hours without food.  '
             'They were then given identical, calorie-controlled cheese '
             'sandwiches to eat. The idea of doing this was to ensure that all '
             'our volunteers started with roughly similar levels of ghrelin in '
             'their blood.  An hour after eating their sandwich each volunteer '
             'was given one of several different soft drinks, allocated at '
             'random.  They either received a glass of a fizzy sugary drink, a '
             'glass of the same drink (but flat), a glass of fizzy water or '
             'one of flat water.  Ten minutes after they had had their drink, '
             "James took a blood sample to measure the volunteers\\' ghrelin "
             'levels.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty '
             "Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  Once he\\'d done that, our volunteers "
             'were sent away with a food diary - so we could assess how many '
             'calories they ate in the hours following their drink.  They had '
             'to come back to the lab three more times over the next couple of '
             'weeks to eat the same cheese sandwich and have bloods taken, but '
             "each time they were given a different drink.  This is what\\'s "
             'known as a crossover trial - the idea being to try different '
             'things on the same person rather than just across a group.  It '
             'means you can produce statistically significant results with '
             'fewer recruits.  ## Ghrelin is the key  Once James had crunched '
             'the numbers we gathered our volunteers together to tell them the '
             'true purpose of our study, which was to assess the impact of not '
             'only the sugar, but the fizziness, on hunger.  What James had '
             'found was that ghrelin levels were about 50% higher when people '
             'had a fizzy drink.  So the fizzy sugary drink makes you a lot '
             'hungrier an hour later than drinking the same drink, but flat.  '
             "This increase in ghrelin wasn\\'t only seen after drinking "
             'sugary fizzy drinks; there was also a slight effect when James '
             'and his team compared the impact of still with carbonated '
             'water.  We also wanted to see what effect drinking carbonated '
             'fizz had on how much food our volunteers consumed later in the '
             'day. And that, in some ways, was even more revealing.  James '
             'says: "If you group together the carbonated drinks and the non- '
             'carbonated drinks, they ate on average 120 calories more after '
             'they had had a carbonated drink than they ate after they had a '
             "non-carbonated drink, and that\\'s a really significant "
             'finding."  So, on top of the 140 calories in the fizzy drink, it '
             'seems they ate another 120 calories later in the day as a direct '
             'result of the extra ghrelin that was produced by having had a '
             'drink with fizz in it.  ## You might also like:  But why should '
             "bubbles have this effect on our hunger signals?  We don\\'t know "
             'for sure, but James thinks there are two possible reasons.  "One '
             'is that after drinking a carbonated drink, carbon dioxide is '
             'released in your stomach. There are chemical receptors in the '
             'stomach which detect carbon dioxide and cause the cells at the '
             'top of the stomach to release ghrelin and it makes you feel '
             'hungry.  Another possibility is it is a mechanical thing. The '
             'stomach bloats and stretches a little bit from that extra gas '
             'and again that stimulates cells to release ghrelin. Those are '
             'the best two possibilities in terms of mechanism."  So is it OK '
             'to drink flat, sugary drinks?  Unfortunately not. According to '
             'James: "The take home message from this is sadly and boringly '
             'that the healthiest option is probably still water."  In terms '
             'of scientific research this is early days, but it provides '
             'another good reason why people should steer clear of sweet fizzy '
             "drinks.  **The new series of**Trust Me I\\'m a Doctor **starts "

             'Media captionTaking out food groups not beneficial, says '
             'nutritionist\\n  A low-carb diet could shorten life expectancy '
             'by up to four years, a study suggests.  Low-carb diets, such as '
             'Atkins, have become increasingly popular for weight loss and '
             'have shown promise for lowering the risk of some illnesses.  But '
             'a US study over 25 years indicates that moderate carb '
             'consumption - or switching meat for plant-based protein and fats '
             '- is healthier.  The study relied on people remembering the '
             "amount of carbohydrates they ate.  ## \\'Gaining widespread "
             "popularity\\'  In the study, published in The Lancet Public "
             'Health, 15,400 people from the US filled out questionnaires on '
             'the food and drink they consumed, along with portion sizes.  '
             'From this, scientists estimated the proportion of calories they '
             'got from carbohydrates, fats, and protein.  After following the '
             'group for an average of 25 years, researchers found that those '
             'who got 50-55% of their energy from carbohydrates (the moderate '
             'carb group and in line with UK dietary guidelines) had a '
             'slightly lower risk of death compared with the low and high-carb '
             'groups.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Carbohydrates '
             'include vegetables, fruit and sugar but the main source of them '
             'is starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and '
             'cereals.  The NHS Eatwell Guide provides details on how to '
             'achieve this kind of healthy, balanced diet and reduce the risk '
             'of serious illnesses in the long term.  Researchers estimated '
             'that, from the age of 50, people in the moderate carb group were '
             'on average expected to live for another 33 years.  This was:  '
             '\\n    * four years more than people who got 30% or less of '
             'their energy from carbs (extra-low-carb group) \\n    * 2.3 '
             'years more than the 30%-40% (low-carb) group \\n    * 1.1 years '
             'more than the 65% or more (high-carb) group  \\n  The findings '
             'were similar to previous studies the authors compared their work '
             'with, which included more than 400,000 people from more than 20 '
             'countries.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Exchanging '
             'carbohydrates for plant-based fats and proteins might promote '
             'healthy ageing, experts said\\n \\n \\n \\n  The scientists then '
             'compared low-carb diets rich in animal proteins and fats with '
             'those that contained lots of plant-based protein and fat.  They '
             'found that eating more beef, lamb, pork, chicken and cheese in '
             'place of carbs was linked with a slightly increased risk of '
             'death.  But replacing carbohydrates with more plant-based '
             'proteins and fats, such as legumes and nuts, was actually found '
             'to slightly reduce the risk of mortality.  Dr Sara Seidelmann, '
             'clinical and research fellow in cardiovascular medicine from '
             "Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital in Boston, who led the research, "
             'said: "Low-carb diets that replace carbohydrates with protein or '
             'fat are gaining widespread popularity as a health and '
             'weight-loss strategy.  "However, our data suggests that '
             'animal-based low carbohydrate diets, which are prevalent in '
             'North America and Europe, might be associated with shorter '
             'overall life span and should be discouraged.  "Instead, if one '
             'chooses to follow a low carbohydrate diet, then exchanging '
             'carbohydrates for more plant-based fats and proteins might '
             'actually promote healthy ageing in the long term."  ## \\\'Not '
             "enough to focus on nutrients\\'  The authors speculate that "
             'Western-type diets that restrict carbohydrates often result in '
             'lower intake of vegetables, fruit, and grains and lead to '
             'greater consumption of animal proteins and fats, which have been '
             'linked to inflammation and ageing in the body.  Prof Nita '
             'Forouhi, from the MRC epidemiology unit at University of '
             'Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: "A really '
             'important message from this study is that it is not enough to '
             'focus on the nutrients, but whether they are derived from animal '
             'or plant sources.  "When carbohydrate intake is reduced in the '
             'diet, there are benefits when this is replaced with plant-origin '
             'fat and protein food sources, but not when replaced with '
             'animal-origin sources such as meats."  However, there are '
             'limitations to the study.  The findings show observational '
             'associations rather than cause-and-effect and what people ate '

             'Media captionTaking out food groups not beneficial, says '
             'nutritionist\\n  A low-carb diet could shorten life expectancy '
             'by up to four years, a study suggests.  Low-carb diets, such as '
             'Atkins, have become increasingly popular for weight loss and '
             'have shown promise for lowering the risk of some illnesses.  But '
             'a US study over 25 years indicates that moderate carb '
             'consumption - or switching meat for plant-based protein and fats '
             '- is healthier.  The study relied on people remembering the '
             "amount of carbohydrates they ate.  ## \\'Gaining widespread "
             "popularity\\'  In the study, published in The Lancet Public "
             'Health, 15,400 people from the US filled out questionnaires on '
             'the food and drink they consumed, along with portion sizes.  '
             'From this, scientists estimated the proportion of calories they '
             'got from carbohydrates, fats, and protein.  After following the '
             'group for an average of 25 years, researchers found that those '
             'who got 50-55% of their energy from carbohydrates (the moderate '
             'carb group and in line with UK dietary guidelines) had a '
             'slightly lower risk of death compared with the low and high-carb '
             'groups.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Carbohydrates '
             'include vegetables, fruit and sugar but the main source of them '
             'is starchy foods, such as potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and '
             'cereals.  The NHS Eatwell Guide provides details on how to '
             'achieve this kind of healthy, balanced diet and reduce the risk '
             'of serious illnesses in the long term.  Researchers estimated '
             'that, from the age of 50, people in the moderate carb group were '
             'on average expected to live for another 33 years.  This was:  '
             '\\n    * four years more than people who got 30% or less of '
             'their energy from carbs (extra-low-carb group) \\n    * 2.3 '
             'years more than the 30%-40% (low-carb) group \\n    * 1.1 years '
             'more than the 65% or more (high-carb) group  \\n  The findings '
             'were similar to previous studies the authors compared their work '
             'with, which included more than 400,000 people from more than 20 '
             'countries.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Exchanging '
             'carbohydrates for plant-based fats and proteins might promote '
             'healthy ageing, experts said\\n \\n \\n \\n  The scientists then '
             'compared low-carb diets rich in animal proteins and fats with '
             'those that contained lots of plant-based protein and fat.  They '
             'found that eating more beef, lamb, pork, chicken and cheese in '
             'place of carbs was linked with a slightly increased risk of '
             'death.  But replacing carbohydrates with more plant-based '
             'proteins and fats, such as legumes and nuts, was actually found '
             'to slightly reduce the risk of mortality.  Dr Sara Seidelmann, '
             'clinical and research fellow in cardiovascular medicine from '
             "Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital in Boston, who led the research, "
             'said: "Low-carb diets that replace carbohydrates with protein or '
             'fat are gaining widespread popularity as a health and '
             'weight-loss strategy.  "However, our data suggests that '
             'animal-based low carbohydrate diets, which are prevalent in '
             'North America and Europe, might be associated with shorter '
             'overall life span and should be discouraged.  "Instead, if one '
             'chooses to follow a low carbohydrate diet, then exchanging '
             'carbohydrates for more plant-based fats and proteins might '
             'actually promote healthy ageing in the long term."  ## \\\'Not '
             "enough to focus on nutrients\\'  The authors speculate that "
             'Western-type diets that restrict carbohydrates often result in '
             'lower intake of vegetables, fruit, and grains and lead to '
             'greater consumption of animal proteins and fats, which have been '
             'linked to inflammation and ageing in the body.  Prof Nita '
             'Forouhi, from the MRC epidemiology unit at University of '
             'Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: "A really '
             'important message from this study is that it is not enough to '
             'focus on the nutrients, but whether they are derived from animal '
             'or plant sources.  "When carbohydrate intake is reduced in the '
             'diet, there are benefits when this is replaced with plant-origin '
             'fat and protein food sources, but not when replaced with '
             'animal-origin sources such as meats."  However, there are '
             'limitations to the study.  The findings show observational '
             'associations rather than cause-and-effect and what people ate '
             'was based on self-reported data, which might not be accurate.  '
             'And the authors acknowledge that since diets were measured only '
             'at the start of the trial and six years later, dietary patterns '
             "could have changed over the subsequent 19 years.  ## \\'High "

             'About Carbs, carbohydrates are one of the ways our bodies get '
             'energy from food.  There are three types - starch, sugar and '
             'fibre.  Starch is what we usually understand carbs to mean - '
             'foods like bread, pasta, potatoes and rice - but these "beige" '
             'varieties aren\\\'t good for you.  Neither are "white" carbs - '
             'found in sugary foods such as fizzy drinks, sweets and processed '
             'and refined foods including cakes and biscuits.  Most of the '
             'starch and sugar in these beige and white carbs are broken down '
             'into glucose for energy, and if you eat too much, the glucose is '
             'stored as fat.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  **Diet '
             'tips**  Reduce:  \\n    * Flour, rice, potatoes, pasta, '
             'breakfast cereals and other processed grains  \\n    * White or '
             'highly processed brown bread  \\n  Replace with:  \\n    * '
             'Cauliflower rice, celeriac, sweet potatoes  \\n    * Rye or '
             'pumpernickel bread \\n  Include:  \\n    * Eggs, meat, fish, '
             'nuts and legumes \\n    * And half of each dish should be green '
             'or brightly coloured: fresh vegetables, salad greens, tomatoes '
             'and aubergines \\n  Take the BBC Food test: How carb-clever are '
             'you?  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  But there is another '
             'type of carb - dietary fibre, found in fruit and vegetables - '
             'what we might call "green carbs". It keeps you full, slows '
             'stomach emptying, and is usually the part of the plant that '
             "supplies you with vitamins and minerals.  It\\'s good for your "
             'teeth and gums and good for your guts, keeping everything moving '
             'and feeding your gut bacteria.  And then there is resistant '
             'starch - found in high-fibre foods such as lentils, beans and '
             'unprocessed whole grains - is also hard to digest in a good way: '
             'it gets right down into your lower digestive tract (your colon) '
             'where its main job is not to feed you but rather to feed your '
             'gut bacteria.  Healthy gut bacteria are linked to a wide range '
             'of benefits, both physical and mental.  And one other tip - '
             'reheating can also turn bad carbs into good - if you reheat '
             'starches like pasta or toasted bread from the freezer, the '
             'molecules reconfigure themselves and become more resistant, '
             'allowing them to travel further in your gut and feed your '

             'hospitals in England will have a legal duty to charge overseas '
             'patients upfront for non-urgent care if they are not eligible '
             'for free treatment.  From April this year, foreign patients '
             'could be refused operations unless they cover their costs in '
             'advance.  NHS Improvement, which oversees the trusts, said '
             'hospitals would no longer have to chase money they are owed.  '
             'Emergency treatment will continue to be provided and invoiced '
             'later.  The announcement from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt comes '
             'amid recent headlines about the cost of tourists using the NHS.  '
             'A BBC documentary, Hospital, showed a number of foreign patients '
             'unable to pay their bills.  Hospitals are already supposed to '
             'charge patients living outside the European Economic Area for '
             'care such as hip operations or cataract removal, but this can be '
             'done by invoice, rather than upfront.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  Details of treatment given to visitors from EEA '
             'countries should be forwarded to the Department of Health so the '
             'costs can be recouped from their governments.  But earlier last '
             'week, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee said the system for '
             'recovering costs from foreign visitors was "chaotic".  Mr Hunt '
             'said: "We have no problem with overseas visitors using our NHS - '
             'as long as they make a fair contribution, just as the British '
             'taxpayer does."  The health secretary said the aim was to '
             'recover up to £500m a year by the middle of this Parliament to '
             'reinvest in the NHS.  A report by the National Audit Office last '
             'October suggested that money raised next year would fall far '
             "short of this target.  * * *  ## \\'Largest\\' unpaid bill  A "
             'Nigerian woman owes £330,000 after giving birth prematurely to '
             'quadruplets in a west London hospital.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  Priscilla, whose case was highlighted in the BBC '
             'documentary Hospital, was taken ill on a flight home from the US '
             "and ended up in St Mary\\'s A&E, after her plane stopped over at "
             'Heathrow Airport.  Her bill is thought to be among the largest '
             'unpaid by an overseas patient - but she has no ability to pay '
             'it.  Priscilla would still have received urgent treatment under '
             'the new arrangements because her life and those of her babies - '
             'two of whom died - were at risk.  The NHS Imperial College '
             "Trust, which includes St Mary\\'s, spent £4m on overseas "
             'patients in 2016 and managed to recoup £1.6m.  * * *  The '
             'changes mean that from April, foreign visitors needing urgent '
             'care will still be treated immediately on the NHS and invoiced '
             'if they are not to be eligible for free care.  But they will '
             'also be told upfront that their care is chargeable before '
             'treatment begins.  It will be up to individual trusts to work '
             'out how best to check eligibility. It is thought some trusts '
             'will ask overseas patients to produce two forms of '
             'identification - including one showing a UK address.  Dr Meirion '
             'Thomas, a former cancer surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, '
             "told Radio 4\\'s Today programme that the plan was a "

             'overseas patients "will not work".\\n  "It is not going to work '
             'because there are not trained people to identify and charge '
             'overseas visitors upfront," he said, highlighting an example '
             'where there was one overseas visitor manager - who identifies '
             'those who do not qualify for free NHS healthcare - for three '
             'hospitals in London.  "Anyone going into any of the Schengen '
             "countries, when they apply for a visitor\\'s visa, they have to "
             'prove that they have 30,000 euros worth of health and travel '
             'insurance and that is the cure for this problem in this '

             'unable to pay their bills.  Hospitals are already supposed to '
             'charge patients living outside the European Economic Area for '
             'care such as hip operations or cataract removal, but this can be '
             'done by invoice, rather than upfront.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  Details of treatment given to visitors from EEA '
             'countries should be forwarded to the Department of Health so the '
             'costs can be recouped from their governments.  But earlier last '
             'week, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee said the system for '
             'recovering costs from foreign visitors was "chaotic".  Mr Hunt '
             'said: "We have no problem with overseas visitors using our NHS - '
             'as long as they make a fair contribution, just as the British '
             'taxpayer does."  The health secretary said the aim was to '
             'recover up to £500m a year by the middle of this Parliament to '
             'reinvest in the NHS.  A report by the National Audit Office last '
             'October suggested that money raised next year would fall far '
             "short of this target.  * * *  ## \\'Largest\\' unpaid bill  A "
             'Nigerian woman owes £330,000 after giving birth prematurely to '
             'quadruplets in a west London hospital.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  Priscilla, whose case was highlighted in the BBC '
             'documentary Hospital, was taken ill on a flight home from the US '
             "and ended up in St Mary\\'s A&E, after her plane stopped over at "
             'Heathrow Airport.  Her bill is thought to be among the largest '
             'unpaid by an overseas patient - but she has no ability to pay '
             'it.  Priscilla would still have received urgent treatment under '
             'the new arrangements because her life and those of her babies - '
             'two of whom died - were at risk.  The NHS Imperial College '
             "Trust, which includes St Mary\\'s, spent £4m on overseas "
             'patients in 2016 and managed to recoup £1.6m.  * * *  The '
             'changes mean that from April, foreign visitors needing urgent '
             'care will still be treated immediately on the NHS and invoiced '
             'if they are not to be eligible for free care.  But they will '
             'also be told upfront that their care is chargeable before '
             'treatment begins.  It will be up to individual trusts to work '
             'out how best to check eligibility. It is thought some trusts '
             'will ask overseas patients to produce two forms of '
             'identification - including one showing a UK address.  Dr Meirion '
             'Thomas, a former cancer surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital, '
             "told Radio 4\\'s Today programme that the plan was a "
             '"smokescreen".  \\n  \\n  '

             'Media captionMeirion Thomas tells Radio 4’s Today that charging '
             'overseas patients "will not work".\\n  "It is not going to work '
             'because there are not trained people to identify and charge '
             'overseas visitors upfront," he said, highlighting an example '
             'where there was one overseas visitor manager - who identifies '
             'those who do not qualify for free NHS healthcare - for three '
             'hospitals in London.  "Anyone going into any of the Schengen '
             "countries, when they apply for a visitor\\'s visa, they have to "
             'prove that they have 30,000 euros worth of health and travel '
             'insurance and that is the cure for this problem in this '
             'country."  * * *  ## NHS Health Check  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state '
             'of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure '
             'during its busiest time of the year.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n '
             "\\n \\n \\n  The doctors\\' union, the BMA, warned of potential "

             'beach](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10EE9/production/_92835396_thinkstockphotos-57576783.jpg)\\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n  Women '
             'and men who regularly trim or remove all their pubic hair run a '
             'greater risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than '
             'those who do not, research suggests.  Doctors say small tears in '
             'the skin from shaving or trimming could make it easier for '
             'infections to take hold.  But they also say groomers - '
             'particularly extreme ones - tend to be more sexually active '
             'too.  STIs are passed on through unprotected sex or genital '
             'contact.  The findings come from a survey of more than 7,500 '
             'American adults, published in Sexually Transmitted Infections - '
             'a specialist BMJ journal.  The report, led by doctors from the '
             'University of California, San Francisco, said the two most '
             'likely explanations for the link between grooming and STIs were '
             'micro-tears in the skin, which increased the risk of viral STIs, '
             'and groomers being more likely to engage in risky sexual '
             'behaviour with more sexual partners.  ## Extreme cut  An '
             'electric razor was the most common tool used for pubic grooming '
             'among men, while a manual razor was more common among women.  '
             'About one in five men and women used scissors.  The researchers '
             'said it was unlikely that sharing grooming tools was an issue, '
             'because traces of the most common STIs had not been found on '
             'objects before.  But they did say doctors should advise groomers '
             'to cut back a little on their grooming or put off having sex '
             'until the skin had healed completely.  Almost three-quarters of '
             'respondents said they had groomed their pubic hair before, with '
             '84% of women and 66% of men saying they had trimmed, shaved or '
             'waxed in the past.  Among the groomers, 17% described themselves '
             'as "extreme" - removing all hair at least once a month - and 22% '
             'as "high frequency" - trimming daily or weekly.  ## Lice '
             'protection  In the survey, any type of grooming was linked to an '
             'increased risk of having a sexually transmitted infection. And '
             'the more frequent and extreme the grooming, the greater the '
             'risk.  Those with the most extreme habits were three to four '
             'times more likely to contract an STI, particularly infections '
             'from skin to skin contact such as herpes and HPV (human '
             'papillomavirus).  But there was good news for groomers too - '
             'because their habit was found to protect against pubic lice.  '
             'The report said: "If grooming is found to protect against lice, '
             'individuals at risk for pubic lice could be counselled to remove '
             'their pubic hair."  * * *  ## What are STIs?  \\n    * Examples '
             'are gonnorhea, herpes, syphilis and genital warts \\n    * The '
             'most common STI is chlamydia, which is easily passed on during '
             'sex \\n    * Young heterosexuals under 25 and men who have sex '
             'with men are most affected by STIs \\n    * Most sexually '

             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n  Women '
             'and men who regularly trim or remove all their pubic hair run a '
             'greater risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than '
             'those who do not, research suggests.  Doctors say small tears in '
             'the skin from shaving or trimming could make it easier for '
             'infections to take hold.  But they also say groomers - '
             'particularly extreme ones - tend to be more sexually active '
             'too.  STIs are passed on through unprotected sex or genital '
             'contact.  The findings come from a survey of more than 7,500 '
             'American adults, published in Sexually Transmitted Infections - '
             'a specialist BMJ journal.  The report, led by doctors from the '
             'University of California, San Francisco, said the two most '
             'likely explanations for the link between grooming and STIs were '
             'micro-tears in the skin, which increased the risk of viral STIs, '
             'and groomers being more likely to engage in risky sexual '
             'behaviour with more sexual partners.  ## Extreme cut  An '
             'electric razor was the most common tool used for pubic grooming '
             'among men, while a manual razor was more common among women.  '
             'About one in five men and women used scissors.  The researchers '
             'said it was unlikely that sharing grooming tools was an issue, '
             'because traces of the most common STIs had not been found on '
             'objects before.  But they did say doctors should advise groomers '
             'to cut back a little on their grooming or put off having sex '
             'until the skin had healed completely.  Almost three-quarters of '
             'respondents said they had groomed their pubic hair before, with '
             '84% of women and 66% of men saying they had trimmed, shaved or '
             'waxed in the past.  Among the groomers, 17% described themselves '
             'as "extreme" - removing all hair at least once a month - and 22% '
             'as "high frequency" - trimming daily or weekly.  ## Lice '
             'protection  In the survey, any type of grooming was linked to an '
             'increased risk of having a sexually transmitted infection. And '
             'the more frequent and extreme the grooming, the greater the '
             'risk.  Those with the most extreme habits were three to four '
             'times more likely to contract an STI, particularly infections '
             'from skin to skin contact such as herpes and HPV (human '
             'papillomavirus).  But there was good news for groomers too - '
             'because their habit was found to protect against pubic lice.  '
             'The report said: "If grooming is found to protect against lice, '
             'individuals at risk for pubic lice could be counselled to remove '
             'their pubic hair."  * * *  ## What are STIs?  \\n    * Examples '
             'are gonnorhea, herpes, syphilis and genital warts \\n    * The '
             'most common STI is chlamydia, which is easily passed on during '
             'sex \\n    * Young heterosexuals under 25 and men who have sex '
             'with men are most affected by STIs \\n    * Most sexually '
             'transmitted infections can be treated, and it is best if '
             'treatment starts as soon as possible \\n  ## How to reduce the '

             'But in many ways it goes to the heart of the dilemma facing the '

             'medicine is advancing all the time, and so people are surviving '
             'diseases and illnesses that in the past would have killed them.  '
             'It can be seen in the growing numbers of people living with '
             'heart disease, cancer, dementia and, in this case, HIV.  It '
             'means the costs to the NHS are rising - all the time.  Close to '
             'three-quarters of the NHS budget goes on treatments aimed at '
             'helping people manage their conditions rather than cure them.  '
             'The response of government and health experts has been to call '
             'for a greater emphasis on prevention to try to stop as many of '
             'these conditions developing in the first place.  Hence, efforts '

             'eating the wrong foods too often.  Prep is a form of prevention '
             '- albeit not aimed at stopping the risky behaviour, rather '
             'reducing the risk that behaviour leads to problems.  In that '

             'Dodd came close to contracting HIV in 2012\\n \\n \\n \\n  An '
             'HIV-preventative drug has been the subject of a legal battle '
             'over which organisation should pay for it. As campaigners win '
             'their High Court case against the NHS, one man tells how taking '
             'the medication has changed his life.  To look at, pre-exposure '
             "prophylaxis (Prep for short) is a small, blue pill - but it\\'s "
             'caused a big controversy.  The drug is not currently available '
             'on the NHS - and an NHS England decision to that effect has '
             'caused a well-documented outcry from charities and campaigners '
             'alike.  However, about 500 homosexual men in England - who form '
             'part of a trial called Proud - have been taking it for years '
             'while experts monitor its effects.  Harry Dodd is one of those '
             'men.  He was invited to take part in the trial after doctors '
             'identified him as a "high risk" sexually active gay man. '
             'However, as he explains, the requirements for being judged as '
             'such were, in his words, "surprisingly low".  "They asked me if '
             "I\\'d had sex without a condom within the last three months, I "
             "said \\'yes\\' and then they asked me if I was likely to have "
             "sex in next three months and again I said \\'yes\\' - and "
             'that\\\'s all it takes to be \\\'high risk\\\'," he said.  And '
             'so, in 2013, Harry started taking Prep and he has remained HIV '
             'negative ever since, despite having unprotected sex.  Taking '
             'Prep protects cells in the body, which are then able to stop the '
             'HIV virus from multiplying - should they be exposed.  Critics of '
             'Prep claim that allowing the drug to be freely available on the '
             'NHS would promote promiscuity and leave people more vulnerable '
             'to other sexually- transmitted infections.  But Harry - who in '
             'the past has had near misses with HIV - vehemently disagrees '
             'with this view.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Prep needs to '
             'be taken daily to build up resistance to HIV\\n \\n \\n \\n  The '
             '25-year-old says the drug has allowed him to grow in confidence '
             'and he goes further, believing it could bring the gay community '
             'closer together and stop discrimination against those who are '
             'HIV positive.  "People need to understand the visceral fear HIV '
             'invokes," he explains.  "I remember when I was younger going for '
             'an HIV test and at the time I was living in a tower block. The '
             "thought fleetingly crossed my mind \\'well at least I can chuck "
             "myself off the balcony if it\\'s the wrong result\\'.  "
             '"I\\\'ve seen the panic on the face of previous boyfriends when '
             "they are awaiting their results - it\\'s a huge fear and it "
             'affects everything you do.  "To be able to have sex without '
             'having that fear hanging over you all the time is huge."  Taking '
             'Prep means the chances of contracting HIV, even if you sleep '
             'with someone who is HIV positive, are greatly reduced.  There '
             'are more than 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK and, '
             'statistically, gay men are the most at-risk group.  The average '
             'HIV prevalence in the UK is 2.3 per 1,000 population. However '
             'for gay men the rate jumps to 48.7 per 1,000. Black African '
             'women are the second most at-risk group with a prevalence rate '
             'of 43.7 per 1,000.  Latest figures show there were 6,151 new '
             'diagnoses made in 2014, up from 6,032 the previous year, '
             'according to Public Health England.  And in London, one in eight '
             "gay men has HIV.  ## \\'I kept it to myself\\'  Harry, who works "
             'for a town planning consultancy in London, can recall a time '
             'when he believes he came perilously close to getting HIV.  "On '
             'Christmas Eve 2012, I was getting off the train in Liverpool to '
             'visit my family.  "The night before I\\\'d slept with someone '
             'I\\\'d been seeing, he was someone I trusted.  "But for the '
             "first time we didn\\'t use a condom. As I approached the station "
             'he messaged me asking about my status.  "I informed him I was '
             'negative and in response he said I should go to A&E - he was '
             'positive and recently diagnosed.  "I kept it to myself, filled '
             'with overwhelming anxiety, fear and shame. How could I tell my '
             'friends and family the truth? It would disappoint them.  "That '
             'situation filled me with mixed emotions... anger both at myself '
             'for not insisting on using protection and at him that he '
             "hadn\\'t told me before the event, but also relief and thanks "
             'that he had told me at all.  "I was confused over whether to '
             'blame, empathise or comfort him. Emotions that tore our '
             'friendship apart, tore me apart and continue to tear communities '
             'apart."  Harry swiftly took himself to A&E, where he was given '
             'drugs to treat exposure to HIV and fortunately tested negative '
             'for the virus subsequently.  But the threat for gay and bisexual '
             'men is very real and the results from the Proud trial - in which '
             'Harry is a participant - are promising.  ## Early results  The '
             'trial took about 500 "high risk" gay men and split them into two '
             'groups.  The first group took Prep straight away, while the '
             'second acted as a control group and waited for 12 months before '
             'taking the drug.  In that control group, 20 people contracted '
             'HIV during those 12 months.  But in the immediate Prep group '
             'only three people contracted HIV and in each case the reason for '
             'contracting the virus can be explained. One person was found to '
             'already have HIV before the trial started and the other two '
             'people both stopped taking the drug for a considerable amount of '
             'time.  The early results were so significant that Prep was given '
             'to all participants before the end of the 12-month period on '

             'Dodd came close to contracting HIV in 2012\\n \\n \\n \\n  An '
             'HIV-preventative drug has been the subject of a legal battle '
             'over which organisation should pay for it. As campaigners win '
             'their High Court case against the NHS, one man tells how taking '
             'the medication has changed his life.  To look at, pre-exposure '
             "prophylaxis (Prep for short) is a small, blue pill - but it\\'s "
             'caused a big controversy.  The drug is not currently available '
             'on the NHS - and an NHS England decision to that effect has '
             'caused a well-documented outcry from charities and campaigners '
             'alike.  However, about 500 homosexual men in England - who form '
             'part of a trial called Proud - have been taking it for years '
             'while experts monitor its effects.  Harry Dodd is one of those '
             'men.  He was invited to take part in the trial after doctors '
             'identified him as a "high risk" sexually active gay man. '
             'However, as he explains, the requirements for being judged as '
             'such were, in his words, "surprisingly low".  "They asked me if '
             "I\\'d had sex without a condom within the last three months, I "
             "said \\'yes\\' and then they asked me if I was likely to have "
             "sex in next three months and again I said \\'yes\\' - and "
             'that\\\'s all it takes to be \\\'high risk\\\'," he said.  And '
             'so, in 2013, Harry started taking Prep and he has remained HIV '
             'negative ever since, despite having unprotected sex.  Taking '
             'Prep protects cells in the body, which are then able to stop the '
             'HIV virus from multiplying - should they be exposed.  Critics of '
             'Prep claim that allowing the drug to be freely available on the '
             'NHS would promote promiscuity and leave people more vulnerable '
             'to other sexually- transmitted infections.  But Harry - who in '
             'the past has had near misses with HIV - vehemently disagrees '
             'with this view.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Prep needs to '
             'be taken daily to build up resistance to HIV\\n \\n \\n \\n  The '
             '25-year-old says the drug has allowed him to grow in confidence '
             'and he goes further, believing it could bring the gay community '
             'closer together and stop discrimination against those who are '
             'HIV positive.  "People need to understand the visceral fear HIV '
             'invokes," he explains.  "I remember when I was younger going for '
             'an HIV test and at the time I was living in a tower block. The '
             "thought fleetingly crossed my mind \\'well at least I can chuck "
             "myself off the balcony if it\\'s the wrong result\\'.  "
             '"I\\\'ve seen the panic on the face of previous boyfriends when '
             "they are awaiting their results - it\\'s a huge fear and it "
             'affects everything you do.  "To be able to have sex without '
             'having that fear hanging over you all the time is huge."  Taking '
             'Prep means the chances of contracting HIV, even if you sleep '
             'with someone who is HIV positive, are greatly reduced.  There '
             'are more than 100,000 people living with HIV in the UK and, '
             'statistically, gay men are the most at-risk group.  The average '
             'HIV prevalence in the UK is 2.3 per 1,000 population. However '
             'for gay men the rate jumps to 48.7 per 1,000. Black African '
             'women are the second most at-risk group with a prevalence rate '
             'of 43.7 per 1,000.  Latest figures show there were 6,151 new '
             'diagnoses made in 2014, up from 6,032 the previous year, '
             'according to Public Health England.  And in London, one in eight '
             "gay men has HIV.  ## \\'I kept it to myself\\'  Harry, who works "
             'for a town planning consultancy in London, can recall a time '
             'when he believes he came perilously close to getting HIV.  "On '
             'Christmas Eve 2012, I was getting off the train in Liverpool to '
             'visit my family.  "The night before I\\\'d slept with someone '
             'I\\\'d been seeing, he was someone I trusted.  "But for the '
             "first time we didn\\'t use a condom. As I approached the station "
             'he messaged me asking about my status.  "I informed him I was '
             'negative and in response he said I should go to A&E - he was '
             'positive and recently diagnosed.  "I kept it to myself, filled '
             'with overwhelming anxiety, fear and shame. How could I tell my '
             'friends and family the truth? It would disappoint them.  "That '
             'situation filled me with mixed emotions... anger both at myself '
             'for not insisting on using protection and at him that he '
             "hadn\\'t told me before the event, but also relief and thanks "
             'that he had told me at all.  "I was confused over whether to '
             'blame, empathise or comfort him. Emotions that tore our '
             'friendship apart, tore me apart and continue to tear communities '
             'apart."  Harry swiftly took himself to A&E, where he was given '
             'drugs to treat exposure to HIV and fortunately tested negative '
             'for the virus subsequently.  But the threat for gay and bisexual '
             'men is very real and the results from the Proud trial - in which '
             'Harry is a participant - are promising.  ## Early results  The '
             'trial took about 500 "high risk" gay men and split them into two '
             'groups.  The first group took Prep straight away, while the '
             'second acted as a control group and waited for 12 months before '
             'taking the drug.  In that control group, 20 people contracted '
             'HIV during those 12 months.  But in the immediate Prep group '
             'only three people contracted HIV and in each case the reason for '
             'contracting the virus can be explained. One person was found to '
             'already have HIV before the trial started and the other two '
             'people both stopped taking the drug for a considerable amount of '
             'time.  The early results were so significant that Prep was given '
             'to all participants before the end of the 12-month period on '
             'ethical grounds.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '

             'the immune system to fight an infection.  Instead, researchers '
             'at the Scripps Research Institute in California have altered the '

             'new section of DNA inside healthy muscle cells.  That strip of '
             'DNA contains the instructions for manufacturing the tools to '
             'neutralise HIV, which are then constantly pumped out into the '
             'bloodstream.  Experiments, reported in the journal Nature, '
             'showed the monkeys were protected from all types of HIV for at '
             'least 34 weeks.  As there was also protection against very high '

             'struggles to change.  "The real strength of this thing is that '
             'it is more potent than any antibody," Prof Farzan said.  '
             'However, there are safety questions.  After conventional '
             'vaccination, the immune system responds only after it is '
             'presented with a threat.  The gene therapy approach turns cells '

             'HIV have cut Aids deaths dramatically in the rich world\\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  For many in the affluent world, HIV has become '
             "yesterday\\'s epidemic. A quarter of a century of drug "
             'development means that for most people who contract the virus it '
             'has become manageable through medication. Yet Aids still claims '
             'many lives in the West.  In a quiet road, a short walk from the '
             'bustle of the High Street in St Albans, Hertfordshire, is an HIV '
             'support group called The Crescent.  Two of its regulars, Mike '
             'and Fiona (not their real names), have come together to share '
             'their experiences of living with HIV on either side of the anti- '
             'retroviral revolution.  Mike, who was diagnosed with HIV in the '
             'late 1980s, aged 26, remembers being part of a support group in '
             'which many fellow members died. He recalls the black humour of '
             'the time.  "It became like a standing joke. Who\\\'s the next '
             'one that\\\'s going to drop like flies, because people were."  '
             'For Mike, it was almost him. He had a brush with death after '
             'returning from a trip to the US.  \\n  ## How does HIV kill '
             'you?  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  HIV stands for '
             'human immunodeficiency virus and on its own it does not kill '
             'you.  \\n  The virus can survive and grow only by infecting, and '
             'destroying, the immune system.  \\n  This continual assault on '
             'the immune system makes it weaker and weaker until it is no '
             'longer able to fight off infections.  \\n  Without treatment, it '
             'takes about 10 years from infection to the development of Aids - '
             'acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  \\n  It is then that '
             '"opportunistic infections", ones a healthy immune system could '

             '\\n \\n  For many in the affluent world, HIV has become '
             "yesterday\\'s epidemic. A quarter of a century of drug "
             'development means that for most people who contract the virus it '
             'has become manageable through medication. Yet Aids still claims '
             'many lives in the West.  In a quiet road, a short walk from the '
             'bustle of the High Street in St Albans, Hertfordshire, is an HIV '
             'support group called The Crescent.  Two of its regulars, Mike '
             'and Fiona (not their real names), have come together to share '
             'their experiences of living with HIV on either side of the anti- '
             'retroviral revolution.  Mike, who was diagnosed with HIV in the '
             'late 1980s, aged 26, remembers being part of a support group in '
             'which many fellow members died. He recalls the black humour of '
             'the time.  "It became like a standing joke. Who\\\'s the next '
             'one that\\\'s going to drop like flies, because people were."  '
             'For Mike, it was almost him. He had a brush with death after '
             'returning from a trip to the US.  \\n  ## How does HIV kill '
             'you?  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  HIV stands for '
             'human immunodeficiency virus and on its own it does not kill '
             'you.  \\n  The virus can survive and grow only by infecting, and '
             'destroying, the immune system.  \\n  This continual assault on '
             'the immune system makes it weaker and weaker until it is no '
             'longer able to fight off infections.  \\n  Without treatment, it '
             'takes about 10 years from infection to the development of Aids - '
             'acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  \\n  It is then that '
             '"opportunistic infections", ones a healthy immune system could '
             'fight off, become deadly.  \\n  \\n  People can die from '

             'HIV is evolving to become less deadly and less infectious, '
             'according to a major scientific study.  The team at the '
             'University of Oxford shows the virus is being "watered down" as '
             'it adapts to our immune systems.  It said it was taking longer '
             'for HIV infection to cause Aids and that the changes in the '
             'virus may help efforts to contain the pandemic.  Some '
             'virologists suggest the virus may eventually become "almost '
             'harmless" as it continues to evolve.  More than 35 million '
             'people around the world are infected with HIV and inside their '
             'bodies a devastating battle takes place between the immune '
             'system and the virus.  HIV is a master of disguise. It rapidly '
             'and effortlessly mutates to evade and adapt to the immune '

             'if it has to change then it will come with a cost," said Prof '
             'Philip Goulder, from the University of Oxford.  ## Weakened  The '
             '"cost" is a reduced ability to replicate, which in turn makes '
             'the virus less infectious and means it takes longer to cause '
             'Aids.  \\n  \\n  Media playback is unsupported on your device  '
             '\\n  \\n  Media captionProf Dausey, Mercyhurst University: "We '
             'have to be cautiously optimistic about this study"\\n  This '
             'weakened virus is then spread to other people and a slow cycle '
             'of "watering-down" HIV begins.  The team showed this process '
             'happening in Africa by comparing Botswana, which has had an HIV '
             'problem for a long time, and South Africa where HIV arrived a '
             'decade later.  Prof Goulder told the BBC News website: "It is '
             'quite striking. You can see the ability to replicate is 10% '
             "lower in Botswana than South Africa and that\\'s quite "
             'exciting.  "We are observing evolution happening in front of us '
             'and it is surprising how quickly the process is happening.  "The '
             'virus is slowing down in its ability to cause disease and that '
             'will help contribute to elimination."  ## Drug bonus  The '
             'findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences also '
             'suggested anti-retroviral drugs were forcing HIV to evolve into '
             'milder forms.  It showed the drugs would primarily target the '
             'nastiest versions of HIV and encourage the milder ones to '
             'thrive.  Prof Goulder added: "Twenty years ago the time to Aids '
             'was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might '
             'have increased to 12.5 years, a sort of incremental change, but '
             'in the big picture that is a rapid change.  "One might imagine '
             'as time extends this could stretch further and further and in '
             'the future people being asymptomatic for decades."  The group '
             'did caution that even a watered-down version of HIV was still '
             'dangerous and could cause Aids.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '
             'Image copyright\\n SPL\\n \\n \\n \\n  HIV originally came from '
             'apes or monkeys, in which it is frequently a minor infection.  '
             'Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of '
             'Nottingham, told the BBC: "If the trend continues then we might '
             'see the global picture change - a longer disease causing much '
             'less transmission.  "In theory, if we were to let HIV run its '
             'course then we would see a human population emerge that was more '
             'resistant to the virus than we collectively are today - HIV '
             'infection would eventually become almost harmless.  "Such events '
             'have probably happened throughout history, but we are talking '
             'very large timescales."  Prof Andrew Freedman, a reader in '
             'infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said this was an '
             '"intriguing study".  He said: "By comparing the epidemic in '
             'Botswana with that which occurred somewhat later in South '
             'Africa, the researchers were able to demonstrate that the effect '
             'of this evolution is for the virus to become less virulent, or '
             'weaker, over time.  "The widespread use of antiretroviral '
             'therapy may also have a similar effect and together, these '
             'effects may contribute to the ultimate control of the HIV '
             'epidemic."  But he cautioned HIV was "an awfully long way" from '
             'becoming harmless and "other events will supersede that '
             'including wider access to treatment and eventually the '
             'development of a cure".  \\n',

             'Coconut oil is as unhealthy as beef dripping and butter, say US '
             'heart experts.  It is packed with saturated fat which can raise '
             '"bad" cholesterol, says the American Heart Association in '
             'updated advice.  Coconut oil is commonly sold as a health food '
             'and some claim the fat in it may be better for us than other '
             'saturated fats.  The AHA, however, says there are no good '
             'studies to support this.  ## Healthy myth?  The advice around '
             'which fats to eat can be very confusing.  Animal fats, such as '
             'lard, are generally seen as bad, while plant oils, such as olive '
             'and sunflower, are seen as healthier options.  That theory is '
             'based on how much of one particular type of fat - saturated fat '
             'or "sat fat" - these products contain.  ## Sat fat  Saturated '
             'fat is said to be bad for our health, although not everyone '

             'Rena-Marie/Getty images\\n \\n \\n \\n  Eating a diet high in '
             'saturated fat can raise the level of "bad" (LDL) cholesterol in '
             'the blood, which, in turn, may clog the arteries and increase '
             'the risk of heart disease and stroke.  According to the AHA, 82% '
             "of the fat in coconut oil is saturated. That\\'s more than in "
             'butter (63%), beef fat (50%) and pork lard (39%). And, like '
             'other saturated fats, studies show it can increase "bad" '
             'cholesterol.  Some claim that the mixture of fats in coconut oil '
             'still make it a healthy option, but the AHA says there is no '
             'good-quality evidence for this.  It says people should limit how '
             'much saturated fat they eat, replacing some of it with '
             'unsaturated vegetable oils - olive oil and sunflower oil, and '
             'their spreads.  ## Healthy swaps  According to the AHA, studies '
             'show swaps such as this can lower cholesterol by the same '
             'magnitude as cholesterol-lowering drugs.  Dr Frank Sacks, lead '

             'stress that fat is still an essential part of a healthy, '
             "balanced diet. We shouldn\\'t cut out too much. Fat is a source "

             "Image caption\\n \\n Don\\'t delay in getting help if you\\'re "
             'having hearing problems\\n \\n \\n \\n  Ten million people in '
             'the UK - one in six of us - have some degree of hearing loss.  '
             'The main causes are hereditary factors, noise exposure, trauma '
             'and ear diseases. And, of course, there is age.  Like getting '
             'fatter and going grey, we tend to think of hearing loss as an '
             'inevitable part of ageing, and it is certainly true that as you '
             'get older your hearing tends to get worse.  More than 40% of '
             'people over 50 have some degree of hearing loss, rising to 70% '
             'of those over the age of 70.  The good news is that there are '
             'things you can do to about it. The bad news is that there are '
             'potentially serious consequences if you choose to ignore hearing '
             'loss, including an increased risk of dementia.  ## How does '
             'having poor hearing affect people?  I have a very personal '
             "interest in this as my hearing isn\\'t as good as it used to "
             'be.  When I go into pubs or restaurants with lots of reflective '
             'surfaces I struggle to hear what is being said. Unlike my '
             'children, who are happily shouting at each other, I sit there, '
             'perhaps catching one word in three and pretending to follow the '
             'conversation.  This is tiring because I am having to concentrate '
             "hard, and it is also embarrassing because I know I\\'m missing "
             "details and yet I don\\'t want to keep asking them to repeat "
             'themselves. "What???" "What????"  For many people, gradual '
             'hearing loss is far more than an inconvenience: it can lead to '
             'social isolation, which in turn can contribute to mental health '
             'problems such as depression.  And there is also mounting '
             'evidence that hearing loss can significantly increase your risk '
             "of developing dementia.  So it\\'s really important that you "
             "don\\'t ignore it. Yet on average, people in the UK wait for a "
             'staggering 10 years before they seek treatment.  According to '
             'the charity, Action on Hearing Loss, only around 40% of people '
             'who need hearing aids have them.  This may be because their GP '
             "hasn\\'t referred them to an NHS audiology service, or because "
             'they are worried about being given a large and very obtrusive '
             "hearing aid.  ## What are the signs you\\'re having hearing "
             'problems?  Although hearing aids are far more discreet and '
             'effective than they used to be, many people are still reluctant '
             'to wear them.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Hearing '
             'what is said across a table in a busy restaurant can be '
             "tricky\\n \\n \\n \\n  Another reason why many people don\\'t "
             "get treatment is because they simply don\\'t notice that their "
             "hearing is declining.  It\\'s surprisingly tricky to spot "
             'gradual hearing loss as our brains are very good at '
             "compensating, so we\\'re not even aware of how much we\\'ve lost "
             'until things are quite far advanced.  Warning signs you may be '
             'losing it include:  • Having the TV on very loud  • Struggling '
             'to follow conversations  • Missing phone calls or the front door '

             "Image caption\\n \\n Don\\'t delay in getting help if you\\'re "
             'having hearing problems\\n \\n \\n \\n  Ten million people in '
             'the UK - one in six of us - have some degree of hearing loss.  '
             'The main causes are hereditary factors, noise exposure, trauma '
             'and ear diseases. And, of course, there is age.  Like getting '
             'fatter and going grey, we tend to think of hearing loss as an '
             'inevitable part of ageing, and it is certainly true that as you '
             'get older your hearing tends to get worse.  More than 40% of '
             'people over 50 have some degree of hearing loss, rising to 70% '
             'of those over the age of 70.  The good news is that there are '
             'things you can do to about it. The bad news is that there are '
             'potentially serious consequences if you choose to ignore hearing '
             'loss, including an increased risk of dementia.  ## How does '
             'having poor hearing affect people?  I have a very personal '
             "interest in this as my hearing isn\\'t as good as it used to "
             'be.  When I go into pubs or restaurants with lots of reflective '
             'surfaces I struggle to hear what is being said. Unlike my '
             'children, who are happily shouting at each other, I sit there, '
             'perhaps catching one word in three and pretending to follow the '
             'conversation.  This is tiring because I am having to concentrate '
             "hard, and it is also embarrassing because I know I\\'m missing "
             "details and yet I don\\'t want to keep asking them to repeat "
             'themselves. "What???" "What????"  For many people, gradual '
             'hearing loss is far more than an inconvenience: it can lead to '
             'social isolation, which in turn can contribute to mental health '
             'problems such as depression.  And there is also mounting '
             'evidence that hearing loss can significantly increase your risk '
             "of developing dementia.  So it\\'s really important that you "
             "don\\'t ignore it. Yet on average, people in the UK wait for a "
             'staggering 10 years before they seek treatment.  According to '
             'the charity, Action on Hearing Loss, only around 40% of people '
             'who need hearing aids have them.  This may be because their GP '
             "hasn\\'t referred them to an NHS audiology service, or because "
             'they are worried about being given a large and very obtrusive '
             "hearing aid.  ## What are the signs you\\'re having hearing "
             'problems?  Although hearing aids are far more discreet and '
             'effective than they used to be, many people are still reluctant '
             'to wear them.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '

             'what is said across a table in a busy restaurant can be '
             "tricky\\n \\n \\n \\n  Another reason why many people don\\'t "
             "get treatment is because they simply don\\'t notice that their "
             "hearing is declining.  It\\'s surprisingly tricky to spot "
             'gradual hearing loss as our brains are very good at '

             'until things are quite far advanced.  Warning signs you may be '

             '\\n  \\n  Media captionHas fat been unnecessarily vilified?\\n  '
             'Is fat the great evil of our time responsible for seducing us '
             'into an early, extra-wide, grave with its delicious succulence?  '
             'Or is it as misunderstood as it is mouth-watering? And in need '
             'of a welcome return to our plates?  As the campaign against '
             'sugar has ratcheted up over the past year or two, there have '
             'been growing voices trying to redeem fat.  For decades it has '
             'been labelled public enemy number one and a "low-fat" food label '
             "is used to convince us that what we\\'re buying is healthy.  The "
             'problem is low-fat can mean vegetables or just clever marketing '
             'for "we took out all the fat and then pumped it full of sugar".  '
             'So there I was having a moment in the supermarket - a tub of '
             'low-fat yoghurt in one hand and a full-fat one in other - '
             'pondering which was actually better for me.  If I had a third '
             "hand, it would have been scratching my head. And I\\'m not "
             'alone.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n  "When there\\\'s a huge wall of '
             'yoghurt, even I find it paralysing," said Susan Jebb, a '
             'nutrition professor at the University of Oxford.  When you take '
             'the fat out of products, particularly dry ones like cake or '
             'biscuits, then something has to replace it.  "It tends to be '
             'sugar - the calories in digestives and low-fat digestives are '
             'almost the same," Prof Jebb continued.  "Lots of yoghurts are '
             'rammed with sugar, that is the thing that annoys me about '
             'yoghurt."  There is a simple answer with yoghurt - a few brands '
             'are both low in fat and sugar, although I need to chuck in a bit '
             'of fruit to make it palatable.  But what about the case that we '
             'should be eating more fat?  Some have argued that the message '
             'about cutting all fats when discussing bad saturated fats from '
             'processed foods was oversimplified.  While others have made the '
             'case that favouring carbohydrates in our diet - particularly '
             'refined carbs like white bread and pasta, is playing havoc with '
             'our hormones to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and making '
             'us pile on the pounds.  * * *  ## More from our Diet Debate '
             'series:  Read: Is breakfast a waste of time?  Watch: How healthy '

             'Is fat the great evil of our time responsible for seducing us '
             'into an early, extra-wide, grave with its delicious succulence?  '
             'Or is it as misunderstood as it is mouth-watering? And in need '
             'of a welcome return to our plates?  As the campaign against '
             'sugar has ratcheted up over the past year or two, there have '
             'been growing voices trying to redeem fat.  For decades it has '
             'been labelled public enemy number one and a "low-fat" food label '
             "is used to convince us that what we\\'re buying is healthy.  The "
             'problem is low-fat can mean vegetables or just clever marketing '
             'for "we took out all the fat and then pumped it full of sugar".  '
             'So there I was having a moment in the supermarket - a tub of '
             'low-fat yoghurt in one hand and a full-fat one in other - '
             'pondering which was actually better for me.  If I had a third '
             "hand, it would have been scratching my head. And I\\'m not "
             'alone.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n  "When there\\\'s a huge wall of '
             'yoghurt, even I find it paralysing," said Susan Jebb, a '
             'nutrition professor at the University of Oxford.  When you take '
             'the fat out of products, particularly dry ones like cake or '
             'biscuits, then something has to replace it.  "It tends to be '
             'sugar - the calories in digestives and low-fat digestives are '
             'almost the same," Prof Jebb continued.  "Lots of yoghurts are '
             'rammed with sugar, that is the thing that annoys me about '
             'yoghurt."  There is a simple answer with yoghurt - a few brands '
             'are both low in fat and sugar, although I need to chuck in a bit '
             'of fruit to make it palatable.  But what about the case that we '
             'should be eating more fat?  Some have argued that the message '
             'about cutting all fats when discussing bad saturated fats from '
             'processed foods was oversimplified.  While others have made the '
             'case that favouring carbohydrates in our diet - particularly '
             'refined carbs like white bread and pasta, is playing havoc with '
             'our hormones to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and making '
             'us pile on the pounds.  * * *  ## More from our Diet Debate '

             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Ministers in England have given the wrong '
             'impression about how much extra they are spending on health, MPs '
             'say.  The government made big play of the extra £8.4bn on top of '
             'inflation it was giving the NHS this parliament when it unveiled '
             'its spending plans last year.  But the Health Select Committee '
             'said the true figure was about £4.5bn.  The MPs said a different '
             'definition of spending was used to give the idea of more '
             'funding. Ministers have rejected the accusation.  The '
             'cross-party group of MPs said instead of focusing on the whole '
             'health budget ministers highlighted the amount going to the '
             'frontline via NHS England.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n  In 2015-16 that was about £101bn, but that ignored £15bn of '
             'money set aside for other aspects such as training and public '
             'health.  This is being cut once inflation is taken into account '
             'and means the total health budget rises from £116bn in 2015-16 '
             'to just over £120bn by the end of the parliament.  MPs said this '
             'was important because the cuts to other areas of spending would '
             'have an impact on everything from staffing to health promotion '
             'schemes, such as obesity programmes, which have a direct impact '
             'on the frontline of the NHS.  The committee also said the scale '
             'of overspending last year - NHS trusts finished 2015-16 £2.45bn '
             'in the red - would mean large chunks of the extra money being '
             'used to cover deficits.  Committee chair Dr Sara Wollaston '
             'added: "Whilst the NHS has been treated favourably compared to '
             'many other departments, the increase in health funding is less '
             'than was promised if assessed by usual definitions."  ## '
             "\\'Flawed\\' policy  But a Department of Health spokesman said "
             'ministers stood by their figures, saying despite public finances '
             'being tight the government had found the money needed.  "We '
             'reject these conclusions," he said.  Meanwhile, leading '
             "researchers have questioned the government\\'s policy of "
             'creating a seven-day NHS at a time when money is so tight.  '
             'Rachel Meacock, from the University of Manchester, called for a '

             '\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Ministers in England have given the wrong '
             'impression about how much extra they are spending on health, MPs '
             'say.  The government made big play of the extra £8.4bn on top of '
             'inflation it was giving the NHS this parliament when it unveiled '
             'its spending plans last year.  But the Health Select Committee '
             'said the true figure was about £4.5bn.  The MPs said a different '
             'definition of spending was used to give the idea of more '
             'funding. Ministers have rejected the accusation.  The '
             'cross-party group of MPs said instead of focusing on the whole '
             'health budget ministers highlighted the amount going to the '
             'frontline via NHS England.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n  In 2015-16 that was about £101bn, but that ignored £15bn of '
             'money set aside for other aspects such as training and public '
             'health.  This is being cut once inflation is taken into account '
             'and means the total health budget rises from £116bn in 2015-16 '
             'to just over £120bn by the end of the parliament.  MPs said this '
             'was important because the cuts to other areas of spending would '
             'have an impact on everything from staffing to health promotion '
             'schemes, such as obesity programmes, which have a direct impact '
             'on the frontline of the NHS.  The committee also said the scale '
             'of overspending last year - NHS trusts finished 2015-16 £2.45bn '
             'in the red - would mean large chunks of the extra money being '
             'used to cover deficits.  Committee chair Dr Sara Wollaston '
             'added: "Whilst the NHS has been treated favourably compared to '
             'many other departments, the increase in health funding is less '
             'than was promised if assessed by usual definitions."  ## '
             "\\'Flawed\\' policy  But a Department of Health spokesman said "
             'ministers stood by their figures, saying despite public finances '
             'being tight the government had found the money needed.  "We '
             'reject these conclusions," he said.  Meanwhile, leading '
             "researchers have questioned the government\\'s policy of "
             'creating a seven-day NHS at a time when money is so tight.  '
             'Rachel Meacock, from the University of Manchester, called for a '
             'pause in the policy, saying the arguments made by the government '
             'that increasing staffing at weekends would cut death rates were '
             '"flawed".  She said pushing ahead with the policy could end up '

             'those in Europe using data from 1998 to 2015.  Splitting the '
             'sample size roughly into two groups the study found that in '
             'Africa 60% of patients were resistant to Tenofovir, whereas in '
             'Europe the figure was only 20%.  The paper, which has been '

             'administration of the drug, in terms of regularly taking the '
             'right levels of Tenofovir could be explanation for the '
             'discrepancy.  "If the right levels of the drug are not taken, as '
             'in they are too low or not regularly maintained, the virus can '
             'overcome the drug and become resistant," Dr Gupta told the BBC '
             'News website.  "Tenofovir is a critical part of our '
             'armamentarium against HIV, so it is extremely concerning to see '
             'such a high level of resistance to this drug," he added.  The '
             'paper also suggested that Tenofovir-resistant strains of HIV '
             'could be passed on from person to person.  "We certainly cannot '
             'dismiss the possibility that resistant strains can spread '
             'between people and should not be complacent. We are now '
             'conducting further studies to get a more detailed picture of how '
             'Tenofovir-resistant viruses develop and spread," Dr Gupta said.  '

             'at the cost of providing an HIV prevention treatment known as '
             'Prep.  It comes as campaigners have said they will seek a '
             "judicial review of NHS England\\'s decision not to commission "
             'the treatment.  Prep is a daily pill that cut the risk of HIV '
             'infection by more than 90%.  Head of NHS England Simon Stevens '
             'says more evidence is needed about the cost versus benefits.  '
             'Speaking to the Health Committee he said: "Prep has great '
             'potential and all of us would like to see it more widely '
             'available in this country."  He said the legal issue about who '
             'should provide the treatment - NHS England or local authorities '
             'which are responsible for prevention-related services - would be '
             'resolved, but the other question was whether it was '
             'cost-effective to roll it out as a preventive treatment.  "This '
             'particular drug is not yet licensed for prophylactic treatment '
             'for HIV.  "Frankly, the prices that the manufacturer is seeking '
             'to charge probably also need to take a substantial haircut to '
             'represent value."  It\\\'s not publicly known how much the '
             'manufacturer of a Prep drug called Truvada is asking for, and '
             'drug companies often reach an agreement to offer the NHS a '
             'reduced price. The book cost for 30 tablets is £355.  As part of '
             'a trial, NHS England has promised £2m in funding to treat about '
             '500 people with Prep over the next two years.  The number of '
             'people living with HIV in the UK continues to increase and the '
             'number living with undiagnosed HIV remains high.  In 2014, an '
             'estimated 103,700 people were living with HIV. An estimated '
             '18,000 (17%) were unaware of their infection.  Condoms can '
             'prevent the spread of HIV but they are not 100% reliable and, of '
             'course, they must be used to work.  \\n',

             '\\n  Charities say NHS England\\\'s "eleventh hour decision to '
             'pull the plug" on game-changing HIV prevention drugs is leaving '
             'people at risk.  The medication- known as Prep - has been shown '
             'in UK studies to reduce the chances of people getting HIV.  '
             'Charities claim they had expected it to start being rolled-out '
             'later this year.  But NHS England officials, who had been '
             'involved in early discussions about Prep, say providing it is '
             'not their responsibility.  Instead they say under health '
             'regulations, preventative medicine (rather than treatment) falls '
             'to individual local authorities to consider.  Meanwhile NHS '
             'England says it will offer £2m worth of funds to treat around '
             "500 people over the next two years.  ## \\'Security\\'  It says "
             'the money, which local authorities will be able to bid for, will '
             'help them consider the overall feasibility and '
             'cost-effectiveness of offering the drugs.  Prep (pre-exposure '
             'prophylaxis) is intended for healthy people who are at high risk '
             'of getting HIV. This would include, for example, men who have '
             'sex with multiple male partners without using condoms.  The '
             'medicine is already available to certain groups in the US, '
             'France, Israel, Canada and Kenya.  And a recent trial by the '
             "UK\\'s Medical Research Council and Public Health England showed "
             'that giving the drugs to healthy gay men at risk, led to an 86% '
             'fall in new infections.  Charities describe the approach as a '
             'game-changer and argue the decision by NHS England fails those '
             'who are vulnerable to HIV.  Dr Michael Brady, medical director '
             'at the charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "For the last 18 '

             '\\n  Charities say NHS England\\\'s "eleventh hour decision to '
             'pull the plug" on game-changing HIV prevention drugs is leaving '
             'people at risk.  The medication- known as Prep - has been shown '
             'in UK studies to reduce the chances of people getting HIV.  '
             'Charities claim they had expected it to start being rolled-out '
             'later this year.  But NHS England officials, who had been '
             'involved in early discussions about Prep, say providing it is '
             'not their responsibility.  Instead they say under health '
             'regulations, preventative medicine (rather than treatment) falls '
             'to individual local authorities to consider.  Meanwhile NHS '
             'England says it will offer £2m worth of funds to treat around '
             "500 people over the next two years.  ## \\'Security\\'  It says "
             'the money, which local authorities will be able to bid for, will '
             'help them consider the overall feasibility and '
             'cost-effectiveness of offering the drugs.  Prep (pre-exposure '
             'prophylaxis) is intended for healthy people who are at high risk '
             'of getting HIV. This would include, for example, men who have '
             'sex with multiple male partners without using condoms.  The '
             'medicine is already available to certain groups in the US, '
             'France, Israel, Canada and Kenya.  And a recent trial by the '
             "UK\\'s Medical Research Council and Public Health England showed "
             'that giving the drugs to healthy gay men at risk, led to an 86% '
             'fall in new infections.  Charities describe the approach as a '
             'game-changer and argue the decision by NHS England fails those '
             'who are vulnerable to HIV.  Dr Michael Brady, medical director '
             'at the charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "For the last 18 '
             'months charities, academics and patients have been lulled into a '
             'false sense of security.  "Because NHS England has been involved '
             'in all the discussions, we had expected the drug to go to a '
             'public consultation and then be commissioned and rolled- out - '
             'with guidance - towards the end of the year.  "Pulling the plug '
             'on this process at the eleventh hour is leaving people at risk '
             'who would otherwise have been protected.  "And the bottom line '

             'Giving daily HIV drugs to healthy gay men has huge potential to '
             'help reverse the epidemic, say scientists.  The medication '
             'prevents new infections by killing the virus before it has a '
             'chance to take hold in the body.  Calculations, published in the '
             'Lancet, indicate giving the drugs to the most at-risk men could '
             'cut new infections by more than 40% in the UK.  Experts said the '
             'approach was of "huge benefit" to at-risk men and should be '
             'adopted.  Men who have sex with men are at high risk of '
             'contracting HIV.  In London, one in eight gay men has HIV, while '
             'the proportion in the rest of the UK is one in 26.  ## '
             'Prevention  While condoms are an effective barrier to HIV '
             'transmission, messages to use them are often ignored.  Last '
             'year, a UK test on 500 men assessed the impact of an alternative '
             'approach called pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep).  It indicated '
             'one case of HIV could be stopped for every 13 men given anti-HIV '
             'drugs for a year.  Scientists at the London School of Hygiene '
             'and Tropical Medicine modelled the impact of introducing such a '
             'treatment across the UK.  They estimated there would be 16,955 '
             'new cases of HIV in gay men by 2020.  But giving Prep to the '
             'most sexually active 25% of gay men would prevent 7,399 '
             'infections (44%).  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Justin Sullivan\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n '
             '\\n The men were given Truvada, which has already been approved '
             'as a preventative drug in the US\\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Narat '
             'Punyacharoensin, one of the researchers, said a focus on regular '
             'HIV tests and condom use "have been falling short".  He told the '
             'BBC News website: "Prep has a great potential to achieve a level '
             'of prevention that could never be achieved by all other HIV '
             'interventions."  He said the cost-effectiveness still needed to '
             'be determined, but "pre- exposure prophylaxis offers a major '
             'opportunity to curb new infections and could help reverse the '
             'HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in the UK".  ## '
             "\\'Huge benefit\\'  Concerns had been raised that men given the "
             'drug would adopt riskier behaviours including stopping using '
             'condoms.  But the test on 500 men, which concluded last year, '
             'found no difference in levels of other sexually transmitted '
             'infections such as chlamydia.  Prof Sheena McCormack, who led '
             'that study at the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit '
             'at UCL, told the BBC: "[It] demonstrated a huge benefit from '
             'adding Prep to the existing risk-reduction package for men who '

             'Giving daily HIV drugs to healthy gay men has huge potential to '
             'help reverse the epidemic, say scientists.  The medication '
             'prevents new infections by killing the virus before it has a '
             'chance to take hold in the body.  Calculations, published in the '
             'Lancet, indicate giving the drugs to the most at-risk men could '
             'cut new infections by more than 40% in the UK.  Experts said the '
             'approach was of "huge benefit" to at-risk men and should be '
             'adopted.  Men who have sex with men are at high risk of '
             'contracting HIV.  In London, one in eight gay men has HIV, while '
             'the proportion in the rest of the UK is one in 26.  ## '
             'Prevention  While condoms are an effective barrier to HIV '
             'transmission, messages to use them are often ignored.  Last '
             'year, a UK test on 500 men assessed the impact of an alternative '
             'approach called pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prep).  It indicated '
             'one case of HIV could be stopped for every 13 men given anti-HIV '
             'drugs for a year.  Scientists at the London School of Hygiene '
             'and Tropical Medicine modelled the impact of introducing such a '
             'treatment across the UK.  They estimated there would be 16,955 '
             'new cases of HIV in gay men by 2020.  But giving Prep to the '
             'most sexually active 25% of gay men would prevent 7,399 '
             'infections (44%).  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Justin Sullivan\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n '
             '\\n The men were given Truvada, which has already been approved '
             'as a preventative drug in the US\\n \\n \\n \\n  Dr Narat '
             'Punyacharoensin, one of the researchers, said a focus on regular '
             'HIV tests and condom use "have been falling short".  He told the '
             'BBC News website: "Prep has a great potential to achieve a level '
             'of prevention that could never be achieved by all other HIV '
             'interventions."  He said the cost-effectiveness still needed to '
             'be determined, but "pre- exposure prophylaxis offers a major '
             'opportunity to curb new infections and could help reverse the '
             'HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in the UK".  ## '
             "\\'Huge benefit\\'  Concerns had been raised that men given the "
             'drug would adopt riskier behaviours including stopping using '
             'condoms.  But the test on 500 men, which concluded last year, '
             'found no difference in levels of other sexually transmitted '
             'infections such as chlamydia.  Prof Sheena McCormack, who led '
             'that study at the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit '
             'at UCL, told the BBC: "[It] demonstrated a huge benefit from '
             'adding Prep to the existing risk-reduction package for men who '
             'have sex with men.  "This publication endorses the impressive '
             'longer term impact that Prep could have on the HIV epidemic '
             'among men who have sex with men in this country, and hopefully '

             'Dr Nita Forouhi, from the MRC epidemiology unit at the '

             'reductionist debate" and warned people to "be careful about '
             'giving oversimplified messages".  But she is at the forefront of '
             'research that might transform the saturated fat debate, bringing '
             'some saturated fats in from the cold.  ## Are all saturated fats '
             'the same?  Once upon a time doctors thought all "cholesterol" '
             'was bad, until they discovered it came in both "good" and "bad" '
             'forms.  Well, now there is a growing realisation that not all '
             'saturated fats are the same and emerging evidence hints that '
             'some types may be beneficial.  A saturated fatty acid is a '
             'string of carbon atoms chained together, but the length of the '
             'chain varies.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n  Saturated fatty acids range from '
             'those with four carbons (butyric acid) to those with 24 carbons '
             '(lignoceric acid). Common ones include palmitic acid (16 '
             'carbons) and stearic acid (18 carbons).  When you look at the '
             'levels of the different saturated fatty acids that end up in the '
             'blood then interesting patterns start to emerge.  People with '
             'higher levels of 16 and 18 carbon saturated fatty acids in the '
             'bloodstream had a higher risk of heart disease.  But those with '
             'more saturated fatty acids with a length of 15 or 17, which is '
             'linked to eating dairy, had a lower risk and the same pattern '
             'emerges in type 2 diabetes.  "These are very exciting findings '
             'and could really advance our understanding," added Dr Forouhi.  '
             'So-called "even-chain" saturated fatty acids such as those with '
             '16 carbons come from dietary fat, but are also made by the body '
             'because of high intakes of refined carbs and alcohol.  So not '
             'only could refined carbs be having a negative effect on blood '
             'sugar levels, they could also be boost "bad" saturated fats in '
             'the blood.  The "odd-chains" come exclusively from the diet and '
             'notably from dairy products.  And Dr Forouhi added: "Our new '
             'findings may also help to explain the reports from studies that '
             'some types of dairy products may cut diabetes or heart disease '
             'risk, somewhat contrary to expectation."  But wait a minute - '
             'were all those headlines right? Should cheese, yoghurt, whole '
             'milk and butter should be firmly on the menu?  \\n  \\n  Media '
             'playback is unsupported on your device  \\n  \\n  Media '
             'captionHow healthy is your breakfast choice?\\n  Dr Forouhi '
             'warned that it was dangerous to take her early evidence and make '
             'such pronouncements.  "We cannot assume that the beneficial '
             "effects of dairy products are solely from the \\'good\\' "
             'saturated fatty acids, after all foods contain a combination of '
             'ingredients."  She warned there was still a "powerful link" '
             'between butter or saturated fat and bad cholesterol and more '
             'targeted studies should now take place on sub- types of '
             'saturated fat.  And specifically on butter she said that most '
             "scientific studies don\\'t actually include it in their "
             'definition of dairy.  More research in this whole field is '
             'taking place, it could dramatically change our understanding of '
             'fat. Or equally it could come to nothing.  Dr Forouhi concluded: '
             '"While that research is going on I don\\\'t think we should just '
             'go changing everything.  "It\\\'s too premature to give the '
             'public the impression that they have a licence, based on this '
             'preliminary research, which is exciting but not yet definitive, '
             'to say butter is back."  Follow James on Twitter.  \\n',

             'some types may be beneficial.  A saturated fatty acid is a '
             'string of carbon atoms chained together, but the length of the '
             'chain varies.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Thinkstock\\n \\n \\n \\n  Saturated fatty acids range from '
             'those with four carbons (butyric acid) to those with 24 carbons '
             '(lignoceric acid). Common ones include palmitic acid (16 '
             'carbons) and stearic acid (18 carbons).  When you look at the '
             'levels of the different saturated fatty acids that end up in the '
             'blood then interesting patterns start to emerge.  People with '
             'higher levels of 16 and 18 carbon saturated fatty acids in the '
             'bloodstream had a higher risk of heart disease.  But those with '
             'more saturated fatty acids with a length of 15 or 17, which is '
             'linked to eating dairy, had a lower risk and the same pattern '
             'emerges in type 2 diabetes.  "These are very exciting findings '
             'and could really advance our understanding," added Dr Forouhi.  '
             'So-called "even-chain" saturated fatty acids such as those with '
             '16 carbons come from dietary fat, but are also made by the body '
             'because of high intakes of refined carbs and alcohol.  So not '
             'only could refined carbs be having a negative effect on blood '
             'sugar levels, they could also be boost "bad" saturated fats in '
             'the blood.  The "odd-chains" come exclusively from the diet and '
             'notably from dairy products.  And Dr Forouhi added: "Our new '
             'findings may also help to explain the reports from studies that '
             'some types of dairy products may cut diabetes or heart disease '
             'risk, somewhat contrary to expectation."  But wait a minute - '
             'were all those headlines right? Should cheese, yoghurt, whole '
             'milk and butter should be firmly on the menu?  \\n  \\n  Media '
             'playback is unsupported on your device  \\n  \\n  Media '
             'captionHow healthy is your breakfast choice?\\n  Dr Forouhi '
             'warned that it was dangerous to take her early evidence and make '
             'such pronouncements.  "We cannot assume that the beneficial '
             "effects of dairy products are solely from the \\'good\\' "
             'saturated fatty acids, after all foods contain a combination of '
             'ingredients."  She warned there was still a "powerful link" '
             'between butter or saturated fat and bad cholesterol and more '
             'targeted studies should now take place on sub- types of '
             'saturated fat.  And specifically on butter she said that most '
             "scientific studies don\\'t actually include it in their "
             'definition of dairy.  More research in this whole field is '
             'taking place, it could dramatically change our understanding of '
             'fat. Or equally it could come to nothing.  Dr Forouhi concluded: '
             '"While that research is going on I don\\\'t think we should just '
             'go changing everything.  "It\\\'s too premature to give the '
             'public the impression that they have a licence, based on this '
             'preliminary research, which is exciting but not yet definitive, '
             'to say butter is back."  Follow James on Twitter.  \\n',

             'SCHWANBERG/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY\\n \\n \\n \\n  Many supposedly '
             '"healthy" fruit snacks aimed at children contain more sugar than '
             'sweets, says a campaign group.  Action on Sugar looked at 94 '
             'products on UK sale, such as coated dried fruit, and found a '
             'third contained three or four teaspoons of sugar and 85% were '
             'more sugary than Haribo Starmix sweets.  Child health experts '
             'said the findings were frightening.  The industry pointed out '
             'that most of the snacks had no added sugars, and those that did '
             'were clearly labelled.  Action on Sugar said that parents should '
             'give their children fresh fruit and vegetables instead of '
             'processed fruit snacks.  And it called on food manufacturers to '
             'stop adding unnecessary sugars to fruit-based snacks while '
             'labelling them as contributing to "one of your five a day".  '
             '\\n  > None of us needs sugar in our diets at all Colin Michie, '
             'Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\\n  \\n  Katharine '
             'Jenner, campaign director at Action on Sugar, said: "Parents '
             "find it hard enough to know what \\'healthy\\' is without food "
             'manufacturers confusing matters with misleading claims.  "Whole, '
             'unprocessed fruit is healthier than processed fruit snacks and '
             'fruit juice drinks, as it contains vitamins, minerals, water and '
             'fibre, and does not cause the devastating tooth decay we see in '
             'young children today."  A child would have to eat an entire '
             'punnet (240g) of strawberries to take in the same number of '
             'grams of sugar as in some processed fruit snacks.  Colin Michie, '
             'chairman of the nutrition committee at the Royal College of '
             'Paediatrics and Child Health, said the findings were "stunning" '
             'and "frightful".  "None of us needs sugar in our diets at all. '
             'It is all completely unnecessary.  "Fruit contains fibre, which '
             'we all need to function properly, but in these snacks the '
             'benefits of fruit have been sacrificed by covering them in '
             'yogurt and other sugary coatings."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '

             '"healthy" fruit snacks aimed at children contain more sugar than '
             'sweets, says a campaign group.  Action on Sugar looked at 94 '
             'products on UK sale, such as coated dried fruit, and found a '
             'third contained three or four teaspoons of sugar and 85% were '
             'more sugary than Haribo Starmix sweets.  Child health experts '
             'said the findings were frightening.  The industry pointed out '
             'that most of the snacks had no added sugars, and those that did '
             'were clearly labelled.  Action on Sugar said that parents should '
             'give their children fresh fruit and vegetables instead of '
             'processed fruit snacks.  And it called on food manufacturers to '
             'stop adding unnecessary sugars to fruit-based snacks while '
             'labelling them as contributing to "one of your five a day".  '

             'Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\\n  \\n  Katharine '
             'Jenner, campaign director at Action on Sugar, said: "Parents '
             "find it hard enough to know what \\'healthy\\' is without food "
             'manufacturers confusing matters with misleading claims.  "Whole, '
             'unprocessed fruit is healthier than processed fruit snacks and '
             'fruit juice drinks, as it contains vitamins, minerals, water and '
             'fibre, and does not cause the devastating tooth decay we see in '
             'young children today."  A child would have to eat an entire '
             'punnet (240g) of strawberries to take in the same number of '
             'grams of sugar as in some processed fruit snacks.  Colin Michie, '
             'chairman of the nutrition committee at the Royal College of '
             'Paediatrics and Child Health, said the findings were "stunning" '
             'and "frightful".  "None of us needs sugar in our diets at all. '
             'It is all completely unnecessary.  "Fruit contains fibre, which '
             'we all need to function properly, but in these snacks the '
             'benefits of fruit have been sacrificed by covering them in '
             'yogurt and other sugary coatings."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '

             'the UK\\n \\n \\n \\n  Nestle, which makes Kitkat and Aero, '
             'recently said it had a found a way of reducing the sugar content '
             'of its chocolate bars by 10% without changing the taste.  '
             'Businesses are being encouraged to meet the sugar reduction '
             'guidelines using three approaches:  \\n    * cutting sugar '
             'levels by 20% across their products  \\n    * reducing the '
             'number of calories in a single serving or reducing the portion '
             'size \\n    * pushing consumers towards "no added" or lower '
             'sugar products \\n  This means that some popular chocolate bars '
             'and tubes of sweets could shrink in size to meet the targets.  '
             'PHE said the guidelines were based on extensive talks with the '
             'food industry and public health bodies.  It said the success of '
             'its sugar reduction programme would be judged on measuring the '
             'net amount of sugar removed from the nine food categories, '
             "starting in March 2018.  ## \\'Change in attitudes\\'  Graham "
             'MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary '
             'University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar welcomed '
             'the sugar reduction targets and urged companies to meet them.  '
             '"We\\\'ve seen over recent weeks that some companies within the '
             'food and drink industry have made great progress whilst others '
             'are seriously lagging behind and others claiming wrongly that '
             'they can\\\'t do it.  "Doing nothing is no longer an option - we '
             'need transparency from them about how they are meeting the '
             'targets with clear nutritional information made available for '
             'restaurants, catering companies and other out-of-home '
             'eateries."  Sue Kellie, deputy chief executive of the British '
             "Dietetic Association, said people\\'s behaviour needed to change "
             'as well.  "The government needs to further restrict the '
             'advertising of high fat, sugar and salt foods before the 9pm '
             'watershed and ban promotions on those same products.  "If we are '
             'to successfully tackle obesity and reduce its long term costs to '
             'the NHS and wider economy, we need to change attitudes and '
             'habits over the long term - there\\\'s no quick fix," she said.  '
             'Dr Amelia Lake, public health nutritionist from Durham '
             'University, said PHE was doing the right thing.  "This is an '
             'excellent approach using strong research evidence and we are '
             'being world leaders on the international stage in our sugar '
             'reduction programme.  "Not only are these foods commonly '
             'consumed by children - but also by the whole family."  \\n',

             'August 2016.  Officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland '
             'have also been involved in producing the guidelines.  A sugar '
             'tax on the UK soft drinks industry has already been announced '
             "and will come into force next April.  PHE\\'s sugar reduction "
             'programme is voluntary and it has no way of forcing the food '
             'industry to comply, but it said many companies had already taken '
             'steps to achieve the sugar targets.  It called the figures '
             '"challenging but achievable, particularly in higher sugar '
             'products".  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '

             'Sugar is regarded as a major cause of obesity among children in '
             'the UK\\n \\n \\n \\n  Nestle, which makes Kitkat and Aero, '
             'recently said it had a found a way of reducing the sugar content '
             'of its chocolate bars by 10% without changing the taste.  '
             'Businesses are being encouraged to meet the sugar reduction '
             'guidelines using three approaches:  \\n    * cutting sugar '
             'levels by 20% across their products  \\n    * reducing the '
             'number of calories in a single serving or reducing the portion '
             'size \\n    * pushing consumers towards "no added" or lower '
             'sugar products \\n  This means that some popular chocolate bars '
             'and tubes of sweets could shrink in size to meet the targets.  '
             'PHE said the guidelines were based on extensive talks with the '
             'food industry and public health bodies.  It said the success of '
             'its sugar reduction programme would be judged on measuring the '
             'net amount of sugar removed from the nine food categories, '
             "starting in March 2018.  ## \\'Change in attitudes\\'  Graham "
             'MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary '
             'University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar welcomed '
             'the sugar reduction targets and urged companies to meet them.  '
             '"We\\\'ve seen over recent weeks that some companies within the '
             'food and drink industry have made great progress whilst others '
             'are seriously lagging behind and others claiming wrongly that '
             'they can\\\'t do it.  "Doing nothing is no longer an option - we '
             'need transparency from them about how they are meeting the '
             'targets with clear nutritional information made available for '
             'restaurants, catering companies and other out-of-home '
             'eateries."  Sue Kellie, deputy chief executive of the British '
             "Dietetic Association, said people\\'s behaviour needed to change "
             'as well.  "The government needs to further restrict the '
             'advertising of high fat, sugar and salt foods before the 9pm '
             'watershed and ban promotions on those same products.  "If we are '
             'to successfully tackle obesity and reduce its long term costs to '
             'the NHS and wider economy, we need to change attitudes and '
             'habits over the long term - there\\\'s no quick fix," she said.  '
             'Dr Amelia Lake, public health nutritionist from Durham '
             'University, said PHE was doing the right thing.  "This is an '
             'excellent approach using strong research evidence and we are '
             'being world leaders on the international stage in our sugar '
             'reduction programme.  "Not only are these foods commonly '
             'consumed by children - but also by the whole family."  \\n',

             "Gonorrhoea could become an untreatable disease, England\\'s "
             'chief medical officer has warned.  Dame Sally Davies has written '
             'to all GPs and pharmacies to ensure they are prescribing the '
             'correct drugs after the rise of "super-gonorrhoea" in Leeds.  '
             'Her warning comes after concerns were raised that some patients '
             'were not getting both of the antibiotics needed to clear the '
             'infection.  Sexual health doctors said gonorrhoea was "rapidly" '
             'developing resistance.  A highly drug-resistant strain of '
             'gonorrhoea was detected in the north of England in March.  That '
             'strain is able to shrug off the antibiotic azithromycin, which '
             'is normally used alongside another drug, ceftriaxone.  In her '
             'letter, the chief medical officer said: "Gonorrhoea is at risk '
             'of becoming an untreatable disease due to the continuing '
             'emergence of antimicrobial resistance."  ## Soaring cases  But '
             'while an injection of ceftriaxone and an azithromycin pill are '
             'supposed to be used in combination, this may not always be the '
             'case for all patients.  Earlier this year, the British '
             'Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) warned that some '
             'online pharmacies were offering only oral medication.  Using '
             'just one of the two drugs makes it easier for the bacterium to '
             'develop resistance.  The letter, which is also signed by chief '
             'pharmaceutical officer Dr Keith Ridge, stated: "Gonorrhoea has '
             'rapidly acquired resistance to new antibiotics, leaving few '
             'alternatives to the current recommendations.  "It is therefore '
             'extremely important that suboptimal treatment does not occur."  '

             'HIV can rapidly form invulnerable strongholds in the body, '
             'dashing hopes that early treatment might cure the virus, '
             'according to new research.  A baby was thought to have been '
             'cured with treatment hours after birth, but the virus emerged '
             'years later.  Monkey research, published in the journal Nature, '
             'suggests untouchable "viral reservoirs" form even before HIV can '
             'be detected in the blood.  Experts described it as a "sobering" '
             'and "striking" finding.  Reservoirs of HIV in the gut and brain '
             'tissue are the massive obstacle in the way of a cure.  '
             'Remarkable progress in developing antiretroviral drugs means HIV '
             'can be kept in check in the bloodstream and patients have a '
             'near-normal life expectancy.  But if the drugs stop, the virus '
             'will emerge from its reservoirs.  International research is '
             'focused on flushing the virus out of its reservoirs, but there '

             "the first place.  ## \\'Established\\'  In the study, rhesus "
             'monkeys were infected with the monkey equivalent of HIV - simian '
             'immunodeficiency virus (SIV).  The monkeys were then given '
             'antiretroviral drugs as early as three days or as late as two '
             'weeks after infection.  Treatment stopped after six months, but '
             'the virus re-emerged irrespective of how quickly antiretroviral '
             'treatment started.  It showed that viral reservoirs formed '
             'incredibly early in the course of the infection.  Dan Barouch, '
             'professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said: "Our data '
             'show that in this animal model, the viral reservoir was seeded '
             'substantially earlier after infection than was previously '
             'recognised.  "We found that the reservoir was established in '
             'tissues during the first few days of infection, before the virus '
             'was even detected in the blood."  \\n  \\n  Media playback is '

             "\\'Rebounding\\'  It had been believed a baby girl born with HIV "
             'had been cured after very early treatment.  The "Mississippi '
             'baby" was given HIV drugs for the first 18 months of life, but '
             'then they were stopped.  Initially the virus did not return and '
             'there was hope she had been effectively cured.  But last week it '
             'was announced that the girl, now four years old, was no longer '
             'in remission after nearly two years off the drugs.  "The '
             'unfortunate news of the virus rebounding in this child further '
             'emphasises the need to understand the early and refractory viral '
             'reservoir that is established very quickly following HIV '
             'infection in humans," Prof Barouch added.  Kai Deng and Robert '
             'Siliciano, of the School of Medicine at Johns Hopkins '
             'University, in Baltimore, Maryland, commented: "These data '
             'indicate that the viral reservoir could be seeded substantially '
             'earlier than previously assumed, a sobering finding that poses '
             'additional hurdles to HIV eradication efforts.  "Although early '
             'treatment may not prevent reservoir seeding, it has been '
             'consistently shown to reduce the size of the reservoir."  They '
             'highlighted significant differences between these experiments '
             'and the human HIV infection, but concluded that the findings '
             '"suggest new approaches in addition to early treatment will be '
             'necessary to eradicate HIV infection".  \\n',

 'newsText': '\\n  \\n \\n \\n ![An older woman from southern '
             'Greece](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/722F/production/_96213292_gettyimages-179278876.jpg)\\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             'Image caption\\n \\n Elderly villagers are well known for their '
             'good health and long lives\\n \\n \\n \\n  Scientists have '
             'pinpointed one reason why people living in isolated villages in '
             'Greece may enjoy long and healthy lives.  They found a new '
             'genetic variant, common among villagers, which appears to '
             'protect the heart by lowering levels of "bad" fats and '
             'cholesterol.  Despite a diet rich in animal fat, the people of '
             'Mylopotamos in northern Crete do not suffer from cardiovascular '
             "disease.  And they really love their cheese.  ## What\\'s "
             'special about these Greek villages?  The isolated villages of '
             'Zoniana and Anogia are high up in the mountains on the island of '
             'Crete.  Few people move in or out of the villages and the '
             'inhabitants are known for living well into old age.  Heart '
             'problems, heart attacks and strokes - all types of '
             "cardiovascular disease - are rare, and that\\'s despite a diet "
             'which includes plenty of lamb and local Cretan cheese.  There is '
             'a cheese festival held every year in the villages, by the way.  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Unhealthy, then?  Well, '
             'this kind of diet would normally be a recipe for lots of health '
             "complications.  That\\'s because eating foods that contain "
             'saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in the blood, and '
             'high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the '
             'blood increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.  The '
             'villagers do get type 2 diabetes at the same rate as the general '
             "Greek population, but they don\\'t seem to suffer from the usual "
             'consequences, such as diabetic kidney disease.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  '

             '\\n Image caption\\n \\n The village of Zoniana is located high '
             "in the mountains of Crete\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## So what\\'s "
             "different about their genes?  That\\'s exactly what researchers "
             'from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute wanted to know.  Was '
             "there something in the villagers\\' genetic make-up that "
             'protected their hearts against disease?  Their research, '
             'published in Nature Communications, identified a new genetic '
             'variant which has heart-protecting qualities.  It is associated '
             'with lower levels of "bad" natural fats and "bad" cholesterol - '
             'which are important for lowering the risk of cardiovascular '
             'disease.  The variant appears to be virtually unique to the '
             'population of the two mountain villages.  Out of thousands of '
             'Europeans who have undergone genome sequencing, only one other '

             'Greece](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/722F/production/_96213292_gettyimages-179278876.jpg)\\n '

             'Image caption\\n \\n Elderly villagers are well known for their '
             'good health and long lives\\n \\n \\n \\n  Scientists have '
             'pinpointed one reason why people living in isolated villages in '
             'Greece may enjoy long and healthy lives.  They found a new '
             'genetic variant, common among villagers, which appears to '
             'protect the heart by lowering levels of "bad" fats and '
             'cholesterol.  Despite a diet rich in animal fat, the people of '
             'Mylopotamos in northern Crete do not suffer from cardiovascular '
             "disease.  And they really love their cheese.  ## What\\'s "
             'special about these Greek villages?  The isolated villages of '
             'Zoniana and Anogia are high up in the mountains on the island of '
             'Crete.  Few people move in or out of the villages and the '
             'inhabitants are known for living well into old age.  Heart '
             'problems, heart attacks and strokes - all types of '
             "cardiovascular disease - are rare, and that\\'s despite a diet "
             'which includes plenty of lamb and local Cretan cheese.  There is '
             'a cheese festival held every year in the villages, by the way.  '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  ## Unhealthy, then?  Well, '
             'this kind of diet would normally be a recipe for lots of health '
             "complications.  That\\'s because eating foods that contain "
             'saturated fats raises the level of cholesterol in the blood, and '
             'high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the '
             'blood increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.  The '
             'villagers do get type 2 diabetes at the same rate as the general '
             "Greek population, but they don\\'t seem to suffer from the usual "
             'consequences, such as diabetic kidney disease.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n SANGER INSTITUTE\\n \\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n Image caption\\n \\n The village of Zoniana is located high '
             "in the mountains of Crete\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## So what\\'s "
             "different about their genes?  That\\'s exactly what researchers "
             'from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute wanted to know.  Was '
             "there something in the villagers\\' genetic make-up that "
             'protected their hearts against disease?  Their research, '
             'published in Nature Communications, identified a new genetic '
             'variant which has heart-protecting qualities.  It is associated '
             'with lower levels of "bad" natural fats and "bad" cholesterol - '
             'which are important for lowering the risk of cardiovascular '
             'disease.  The variant appears to be virtually unique to the '
             'population of the two mountain villages.  Out of thousands of '
             'Europeans who have undergone genome sequencing, only one other '
             'person in Italy possesses this variant, the researchers said.  '
