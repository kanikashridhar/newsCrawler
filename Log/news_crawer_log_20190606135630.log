             'chairman of selectors during the 1996 World Cup  If 1992 was the '

             'and floodlights, then the 1996 event in India, Pakistan and Sri '
             'Lanka was when one-day cricket grew up.  With Sri Lanka '
             'providing the rest with an epiphany thanks to the swashbuckling '
             'of Sanath Jayasuriya at the top of the order, England took '
             'longer to wake up than most.  "We were not anywhere near as '
             'forward-thinking," said Neil Smith, who had been called-up for '
             'his off-spin, but ended up opening the batting.  "The side was '
             "packed with quality cricketers, but there wasn\\'t the clarity "
             'of thought."  As England limped through their group, Smith would '
             'provide an infamous World Cup moment.  "We took pills every day '
             "to stop us being ill. They were the size that you\\'d give to a "
             'donkey, the theory being they would stop us being ill. Prior to '
             'the interval in the game against UAE I started feeling unwell '
             'and it got slowly worse.  "I went out to open the batting and '
             "knew I wasn\\'t feeling good. I couldn\\'t get a drink brought "
             'out because the World Cup was during Ramadan. When we took '
             'drinks breaks, we actually left the field. The physio reminded '
             "me that I couldn\\'t have a drink and I couldn\\'t go off in the "
             'middle of an over, just to have a drink and take a pill.  "After '
             'that, I ran a three and that was the end of it. I ran through, '
             'past the keeper and threw up."  At the time, straight-talking '
             "Yorkshireman Ray Illingworth was England\\'s coach, manager and "
             'chairman of selectors and said of Smith\\\'s plight: "He had a '
             'pizza last night. Now it\\\'s on the field out there."  Smith '
             'continued: "I came from a successful Warwickshire team where we '
             'talked things through. As a new player I thought I might get a '
             'bit of input from Ray, but I didn\\\'t get anything at all.  "We '
             'had two discussions - one about Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, '
             'and the other about holiday homes in Spain."  In the '
             'quarter-finals, England were hammered by Sri Lanka. So dominant '
             'were the eventual champions that pace bowler Phil DeFreitas '
             'started bowling off- spin while the omitted Smith watched on.  '
             '"It was difficult to sit and watch from a personal point of view '
             "and it highlighted that we didn\\'t have enough to cope with how "
             'the game was shifting in momentum.  "The rest of the world were '
             'playing a different one-day game."  ### 1999 - \\\'It was '
             "shambolic\\'  \\n England failed to make it past the group stage "
             'the last time the World Cup was hosted in the country in 1999  '
             'In 1999, cricket was supposed to come home, but hosts England '
             "were knocked out even before the tournament\\'s official song "
             'was released.  The problems, though, had started months '
             'earlier.  "There were issues with contracts," said then-England '
             'captain Alec Stewart. "Simon Pack, the ECB\\\'s international '
             'teams director, came to see me on the afternoon before the first '
             'day of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane the previous winter. '
             'That summed it up. We were trying to compete in an Ashes series '
             "and he wanted to talk about something that wasn\\'t going to "
             'happen for five months.  "It didn\\\'t get any better. We '
             "didn\\'t get the squad that coach David Lloyd and myself wanted. "
             'We wanted Chris Lewis, but were told in no uncertain terms that '
             'we weren\\\'t allowed to consider him.  "We didn\\\'t get the '
             'preparations we wanted. We wanted to train in Leicester, because '
             'they were the best facilities, but were told to go to '
             'Canterbury.  "Even before that, we went to play in Sharjah and '
             'Lahore, when we should have been in England. We should have been '
             'getting a headstart on the opposition, but we were sent out '
             'there. It was shambolic."  England\\\'s fate was sealed by a '
             'loss to India at Edgbaston. They went out on net run-rate - a '
             'problem that could have been avoided with some forward '
             'planning.  "We messed up in the win against Kenya at '
             'Canterbury," said Stewart. "The last 25 or so runs we needed '
             'took forever for us to get.  "Instead of knocking them off as '
             'quickly as possible, people turned it into a bit of practice. We '
             'should have won the game convincingly, taking net run-rate into '
             'consideration."  The dismal exit signaled the end of '
             'Stewart\\\'s reign.  "We had to go back to play county cricket '
             'and watched the rest of the world play some very good cricket.  '
             '"I had been appointed captain until the end of the World Cup and '
             'everyone knew what was going to happen after that. It still took '
             "them three weeks to tell me I wasn\\'t going to be captain "
             'anymore."  ### 2003 - \\\'The players had to make a stance\\\'  '
             '\\n England players held meetings with ICC and ECB officials '
             'before deciding to forfeit their match against Zimbabwe  Of all '
             "of England\\'s World Cup failures, this one has the least blame "
             'attached to the players.  In a tournament held in South Africa, '
             'Kenya and Zimbabwe, the British government did not want England '
             'to play their game in Zimbabwe for fear of being seen to support '
             'President Robert Mugabe.  However, it stopped short of ordering '
             'a boycott and the England and Wales Cricket Board, concerned '
             'about the financial implications of failing to fulfil the '
             'fixture, was reluctant to pull out of the game.  All the while, '
             'the International Cricket Council was adamant the match should '
             'go ahead unless there was a security reason for it not to.  "The '
             'ICC should never have put those two teams together at that '
             'venue." said former England fast bowler Andy Caddick. "The ICC '
             'wouldn\\\'t budge, so the players had to make a stance."  With '
             'the game less than a week away, the England team learnt of a '
             'threat issued by a group called the Sons and Daughters of '
             'Zimbabwe. It said: "Come to Zimbabwe and you will go back to '
             'Britain in wooden coffins."  Caddick continued: "We had a number '
             'of meetings in the Cullinan Hotel in Cape Town. The British High '
             'commissioner was there, the ECB were there and there were '
             'representatives from the ICC. At the end of the day, they all '
             'left and the players made the decision.  "We as a team said that '
             'there was no way we were going.  "We were there to play sport. '
             'Politics should never have been involved. But when there are '
             'threats against yourself and your family, what is the game '
             'worth? Nothing."  England forfeited the match to Zimbabwe. As it '
             'turned out, if they had gone to Harare and won, they would have '
             'advanced to the Super Six stage.  From there, they may well have '
             'had the chance to reach the semi-finals in a tournament where '
             'lowly Kenya made it to the last four.  "We had a talented side," '
             'Caddick said. "You can kick yourself and say we should have gone '
             'to Zimbabwe, but we did what we had to do.  "It goes back to the '
             'simple fact that the ICC had the power to sort it out, but they '
             'let world cricket down."  ### 2007 - \\\'I was still wet with '
             "sand between my toes\\'  \\n Andrew Flintoff was fined, stripped "
             "of the vice-captaincy and banned from England\\'s next game for "
             'his late night pedalo incident  Held in the Caribbean, a dire '
             'tournament beset by organisational problems and concluding with '
             'a final that ended in near darkness was overshadowed by the '
             "death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer.  From England\\'s point of "
             'view, it will always be remembered for the late-night drinking '
             'session of Andrew Flintoff that resulted in him taking a pedalo '
             'boat into the sea.  Speaking in 2014, Flintoff explained: "About '
             "1.30am I thought: \\'I\\'m hammered here, go home\\'. I had to "
             'walk partially across the beach. For some reason I had an idea '
             'about the boats out to sea - I knew Ian Botham was on one and I '
             "thought: \\'I\\'m going to have a nightcap with Beefy\\'. I "
             'dragged a pedalo into the water."  When the pedalo capsized, '
             'Flintoff had to be pulled from the sea. Next morning, when he '
             'woke "still wet and with sand between my toes" he was hauled '
             'into a team meeting.  Later, coach Duncan Fletcher put Flintoff '
             'in front of the media to apologise. He was stripped of the '
             "vice-captaincy, banned from England\\'s next game and was one of "
             'six players fined for breaking a curfew.  And all that came '
             'after England had played only one match.  They eventually '
             'reached the Super Six stage, where a two-run defeat by Sri Lanka '
             'ultimately left a place in the semi-finals at stake when they '
             'met South Africa.  England were crushed by nine wickets.  "You '
             'can look at things like the pedalo incident and think it had a '
             'massive effect, but it didn\\\'t really," said then-captain '
             'Michael Vaughan.  "You can make excuses, but we weren\\\'t good '
             'enough. We had a Test team that was playing one-day cricket. On '
             "the field, not a lot happened for us. It\\'s one to put a black "
             'mark next to."  ### 2011 - \\\'Like Moneyball, without '
             "statistical back-up\\'  \\n England\\'s most infamous defeat at "
             'the 2011 World Cup was against Ireland  On the back of winning '
             'the Ashes in Australia, England fell flat in India, Sri Lanka '
             'and Bangladesh, but at least managed to throw up some of the '
             "tournament\\'s most memorable moments.  Most infamously was the "
             'defeat by Ireland, who were inspired to chase 328 by Kevin '
             'O\\\'Brien.  "I never thought they\\\'d get them until they were '
             'really close to winning," said former England off-spinner Graeme '
             'Swann. "When I finished my 10 overs I thought \\\'there\\\'s no '
             'chance in the world that we\\\'ll lose this game\\\'.  "In the '
             'last 10 overs, I was on the physio bed with a tweaked hamstring. '
             "I could hear roar, after roar knowing that it wasn\\'t for a "
             "wicket, thinking \\'he\\'s got to get out some time\\'.  "
             '"When you lose a game like that you feel humiliated, you know '
             "you\\'re going to get nailed by the press and that you\\'ll be "
             "the butt of jokes, but we didn\\'t do a lot wrong and Kevin "
             'O\\\'Brien batted like a deity."  Despite also losing to '
             'Bangladesh, England squeezed through to the quarter- finals, '
             'where they once again came up against Sri Lanka.  Just like 15 '
             'years earlier, they were steamrollered, as the eventual runners- '
             'up knocked off 230 with more than 10 overs to spare and all 10 '
             'wickets in hand.  "Tillakaratne Dilshan got a hundred and, near '
             'the end, was blocking it because he wanted Upul Tharanga to get '
             'to 100 too," said Swann. "I was bowling moon balls and he was '
             'still blocking them. It was humiliating, really.  "We were still '
             'very much tied to stats and believing what a computer said '
             'should be a competitive total, rather than just playing the '
             'conditions.  "We played to the doctrine of \\\'if you have this '
             'many wickets in hand at a certain point, or if you get this '
             "score you\\'ll win this amount of games\\'. It was like "
             'Moneyball without the proper statistical back-up."  Prior to '
             'that game, Michael Yardy left the tournament because he was '
             'suffering from depression.  "I felt a bit ashamed that I '
             'hadn\\\'t picked up on it," said Swann. "As a fellow spinner, I '
             'thought I should have known a bit more about what was going on. '
             'It turned out that no one did apart from Matt Prior.  "There was '
             'shock in the room, but at that stage no one really knew how to '
             "react to mental health problems. I\\'m glad it\\'s talked about "
             'these days, because we were out of our depth."  ### 2015 - '
             "\\'Dejection, disappointment and embarrassment\\'  \\n A defeat "
             "to Bangladesh sealed England\\'s elimination at the Cricket "
             "World Cup 2015  Of all England\\'s World Cup failures, they had "
             'never been further behind the rest than in Australia and New '
             'Zealand.  The warning signs were there in a chaotic build-up '
             'which saw captain Alastair Cook replaced by Eoin Morgan. Even on '
             'the eve of their opening game against Australia, England were '
             'tinkering with their batting order.  "We didn\\\'t know our best '
             "XI, we didn\\'t know who was going to open the batting, who was "
             'batting three and we didn\\\'t know our best bowling attack," '
             'said fast bowler James Anderson.  "There would have been players '
             'the night before not sure whether they were playing, or guys '
             "that hadn\\'t played a lot of cricket in the positions they were "
             'going to be in. Two, three or four players being unsure of what '
             'they are doing is going to have a detrimental effect on the '
             'side."  As the rest of the teams belted the ball to all parts, '
             'England plodded along, suffering huge defeats by Australia, New '
             'Zealand and Sri Lanka.  "We had a new captain trying to put his '
             'stamp on the team at a global event," said Anderson. "He should '
             'have been doing that months or even years in advance. We '
             'didn\\\'t know what sort of team we were.  "We had plans for our '
             "batting that were quite structured, but it just didn\\'t work "
             'for us. We were careful, often in our own shells. Maybe people '
             'were looking after their own games, rather than thinking about '
             'the bigger picture."  Their final chance to make the '
             'quarter-finals, against Bangladesh in Adelaide, ended in perhaps '
             'England\\\'s worst ever World Cup result.  "We didn\\\'t think '
             '\\\'it\\\'s just Bangladesh\\\'," said Anderson. "We were very '
             'conscious of not taking them for granted. We bowled OK and kept '
             'them to a decent total and were in a good position chasing, but '
             'we kept losing wickets and I was last man out. A lack of '
             'confidence beat us.  "We were dejected, disappointed and '
             'embarrassed. We just weren\\\'t good enough."  \\n',

             "knockout match since 1992  ICC Men\\'s Cricket World Cup 2019   "
             '---    **Dates:** 30 May - 14 July, 2019    **Live coverage:** '
             'Ball-by-ball commentary on Test Match Special, plus text '
             'commentary, clips and highlights on the BBC Sport website      '
             'You have to know the past to understand the present.  That '
             'England enter the World Cup as favourites and number one ranked '
             'team on the planet is an incredible transformation not only from '
             'the abject failure of the 2015 tournament, but the five previous '
             'editions too.  Since they last reached the final in 1992, they '
             'have lost exactly half of their 38 World Cup matches and only '
             'seven of their 18 victories have come against Test-playing '
             'teams. Not one of those has been in a knockout match.  These are '
             "England\\'s World Cup tales of woe, told by the men who were "
             'there. From food poisoning to the Fredalo, death threats to a '
             "lot of defeats.  ### 1996 - \\'I ran past the keeper and threw "
             "up\\'  \\n Ray Illingworth was England\\'s coach, manager and "
             'chairman of selectors during the 1996 World Cup  If 1992 was the '
             'rebirth of the World Cup, with coloured clothing, white balls '
             'and floodlights, then the 1996 event in India, Pakistan and Sri '
             'Lanka was when one-day cricket grew up.  With Sri Lanka '
             'providing the rest with an epiphany thanks to the swashbuckling '
             'of Sanath Jayasuriya at the top of the order, England took '
             'longer to wake up than most.  "We were not anywhere near as '
             'forward-thinking," said Neil Smith, who had been called-up for '
             'his off-spin, but ended up opening the batting.  "The side was '
             "packed with quality cricketers, but there wasn\\'t the clarity "
             'of thought."  As England limped through their group, Smith would '
             'provide an infamous World Cup moment.  "We took pills every day '
             "to stop us being ill. They were the size that you\\'d give to a "
             'donkey, the theory being they would stop us being ill. Prior to '
             'the interval in the game against UAE I started feeling unwell '
             'and it got slowly worse.  "I went out to open the batting and '
             "knew I wasn\\'t feeling good. I couldn\\'t get a drink brought "
             'out because the World Cup was during Ramadan. When we took '
             'drinks breaks, we actually left the field. The physio reminded '
             "me that I couldn\\'t have a drink and I couldn\\'t go off in the "
             'middle of an over, just to have a drink and take a pill.  "After '
             'that, I ran a three and that was the end of it. I ran through, '
             'past the keeper and threw up."  At the time, straight-talking '
             "Yorkshireman Ray Illingworth was England\\'s coach, manager and "
             'chairman of selectors and said of Smith\\\'s plight: "He had a '
             'pizza last night. Now it\\\'s on the field out there."  Smith '
             'continued: "I came from a successful Warwickshire team where we '
             'talked things through. As a new player I thought I might get a '
             'bit of input from Ray, but I didn\\\'t get anything at all.  "We '
             'had two discussions - one about Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, '
             'and the other about holiday homes in Spain."  In the '
             'quarter-finals, England were hammered by Sri Lanka. So dominant '
             'were the eventual champions that pace bowler Phil DeFreitas '
             'started bowling off- spin while the omitted Smith watched on.  '
             '"It was difficult to sit and watch from a personal point of view '
             "and it highlighted that we didn\\'t have enough to cope with how "
             'the game was shifting in momentum.  "The rest of the world were '
             'playing a different one-day game."  ### 1999 - \\\'It was '
             "shambolic\\'  \\n England failed to make it past the group stage "
             'the last time the World Cup was hosted in the country in 1999  '
             'In 1999, cricket was supposed to come home, but hosts England '
             "were knocked out even before the tournament\\'s official song "
             'was released.  The problems, though, had started months '
             'earlier.  "There were issues with contracts," said then-England '
             'captain Alec Stewart. "Simon Pack, the ECB\\\'s international '
             'teams director, came to see me on the afternoon before the first '
             'day of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane the previous winter. '
             'That summed it up. We were trying to compete in an Ashes series '
             "and he wanted to talk about something that wasn\\'t going to "
             'happen for five months.  "It didn\\\'t get any better. We '
             "didn\\'t get the squad that coach David Lloyd and myself wanted. "
             'We wanted Chris Lewis, but were told in no uncertain terms that '
             'we weren\\\'t allowed to consider him.  "We didn\\\'t get the '
             'preparations we wanted. We wanted to train in Leicester, because '
             'they were the best facilities, but were told to go to '
             'Canterbury.  "Even before that, we went to play in Sharjah and '
             'Lahore, when we should have been in England. We should have been '
             'getting a headstart on the opposition, but we were sent out '
             'there. It was shambolic."  England\\\'s fate was sealed by a '
             'loss to India at Edgbaston. They went out on net run-rate - a '
             'problem that could have been avoided with some forward '
             'planning.  "We messed up in the win against Kenya at '
             'Canterbury," said Stewart. "The last 25 or so runs we needed '
             'took forever for us to get.  "Instead of knocking them off as '
             'quickly as possible, people turned it into a bit of practice. We '
             'should have won the game convincingly, taking net run-rate into '
             'consideration."  The dismal exit signaled the end of '
             'Stewart\\\'s reign.  "We had to go back to play county cricket '
             'and watched the rest of the world play some very good cricket.  '
             '"I had been appointed captain until the end of the World Cup and '
             'everyone knew what was going to happen after that. It still took '
             "them three weeks to tell me I wasn\\'t going to be captain "
             'anymore."  ### 2003 - \\\'The players had to make a stance\\\'  '
             '\\n England players held meetings with ICC and ECB officials '
             'before deciding to forfeit their match against Zimbabwe  Of all '
             "of England\\'s World Cup failures, this one has the least blame "
             'attached to the players.  In a tournament held in South Africa, '
             'Kenya and Zimbabwe, the British government did not want England '
             'to play their game in Zimbabwe for fear of being seen to support '
             'President Robert Mugabe.  However, it stopped short of ordering '
             'a boycott and the England and Wales Cricket Board, concerned '
             'about the financial implications of failing to fulfil the '
             'fixture, was reluctant to pull out of the game.  All the while, '
             'the International Cricket Council was adamant the match should '
             'go ahead unless there was a security reason for it not to.  "The '
             'ICC should never have put those two teams together at that '
             'venue." said former England fast bowler Andy Caddick. "The ICC '
             'wouldn\\\'t budge, so the players had to make a stance."  With '
             'the game less than a week away, the England team learnt of a '
             'threat issued by a group called the Sons and Daughters of '
             'Zimbabwe. It said: "Come to Zimbabwe and you will go back to '
             'Britain in wooden coffins."  Caddick continued: "We had a number '
             'of meetings in the Cullinan Hotel in Cape Town. The British High '
             'commissioner was there, the ECB were there and there were '
             'representatives from the ICC. At the end of the day, they all '
             'left and the players made the decision.  "We as a team said that '
             'there was no way we were going.  "We were there to play sport. '
             'Politics should never have been involved. But when there are '
             'threats against yourself and your family, what is the game '
             'worth? Nothing."  England forfeited the match to Zimbabwe. As it '
             'turned out, if they had gone to Harare and won, they would have '
             'advanced to the Super Six stage.  From there, they may well have '
             'had the chance to reach the semi-finals in a tournament where '
             'lowly Kenya made it to the last four.  "We had a talented side," '
             'Caddick said. "You can kick yourself and say we should have gone '
             'to Zimbabwe, but we did what we had to do.  "It goes back to the '
             'simple fact that the ICC had the power to sort it out, but they '
             'let world cricket down."  ### 2007 - \\\'I was still wet with '
             "sand between my toes\\'  \\n Andrew Flintoff was fined, stripped "
             "of the vice-captaincy and banned from England\\'s next game for "
             'his late night pedalo incident  Held in the Caribbean, a dire '
             'tournament beset by organisational problems and concluding with '
             'a final that ended in near darkness was overshadowed by the '
             "death of Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer.  From England\\'s point of "
             'view, it will always be remembered for the late-night drinking '
             'session of Andrew Flintoff that resulted in him taking a pedalo '
             'boat into the sea.  Speaking in 2014, Flintoff explained: "About '
             "1.30am I thought: \\'I\\'m hammered here, go home\\'. I had to "
             'walk partially across the beach. For some reason I had an idea '
             'about the boats out to sea - I knew Ian Botham was on one and I '
             "thought: \\'I\\'m going to have a nightcap with Beefy\\'. I "
             'dragged a pedalo into the water."  When the pedalo capsized, '
             'Flintoff had to be pulled from the sea. Next morning, when he '
             'woke "still wet and with sand between my toes" he was hauled '
             'into a team meeting.  Later, coach Duncan Fletcher put Flintoff '
             'in front of the media to apologise. He was stripped of the '
             "vice-captaincy, banned from England\\'s next game and was one of "
             'six players fined for breaking a curfew.  And all that came '
             'after England had played only one match.  They eventually '
             'reached the Super Six stage, where a two-run defeat by Sri Lanka '
             'ultimately left a place in the semi-finals at stake when they '
             'met South Africa.  England were crushed by nine wickets.  "You '
             'can look at things like the pedalo incident and think it had a '
             'massive effect, but it didn\\\'t really," said then-captain '
             'Michael Vaughan.  "You can make excuses, but we weren\\\'t good '
             'enough. We had a Test team that was playing one-day cricket. On '
             "the field, not a lot happened for us. It\\'s one to put a black "
             'mark next to."  ### 2011 - \\\'Like Moneyball, without '
             "statistical back-up\\'  \\n England\\'s most infamous defeat at "
             'the 2011 World Cup was against Ireland  On the back of winning '
             'the Ashes in Australia, England fell flat in India, Sri Lanka '
             'and Bangladesh, but at least managed to throw up some of the '
             "tournament\\'s most memorable moments.  Most infamously was the "
             'defeat by Ireland, who were inspired to chase 328 by Kevin '
             'O\\\'Brien.  "I never thought they\\\'d get them until they were '
             'really close to winning," said former England off-spinner Graeme '
             'Swann. "When I finished my 10 overs I thought \\\'there\\\'s no '
             'chance in the world that we\\\'ll lose this game\\\'.  "In the '
             'last 10 overs, I was on the physio bed with a tweaked hamstring. '
             "I could hear roar, after roar knowing that it wasn\\'t for a "
             "wicket, thinking \\'he\\'s got to get out some time\\'.  "
             '"When you lose a game like that you feel humiliated, you know '
             "you\\'re going to get nailed by the press and that you\\'ll be "
             "the butt of jokes, but we didn\\'t do a lot wrong and Kevin "
             'O\\\'Brien batted like a deity."  Despite also losing to '
             'Bangladesh, England squeezed through to the quarter- finals, '
             'where they once again came up against Sri Lanka.  Just like 15 '
             'years earlier, they were steamrollered, as the eventual runners- '
             'up knocked off 230 with more than 10 overs to spare and all 10 '
             'wickets in hand.  "Tillakaratne Dilshan got a hundred and, near '
             'the end, was blocking it because he wanted Upul Tharanga to get '
             'to 100 too," said Swann. "I was bowling moon balls and he was '
             'still blocking them. It was humiliating, really.  "We were still '
             'very much tied to stats and believing what a computer said '
             'should be a competitive total, rather than just playing the '
             'conditions.  "We played to the doctrine of \\\'if you have this '
             'many wickets in hand at a certain point, or if you get this '
             "score you\\'ll win this amount of games\\'. It was like "
             'Moneyball without the proper statistical back-up."  Prior to '
             'that game, Michael Yardy left the tournament because he was '
             'suffering from depression.  "I felt a bit ashamed that I '
             'hadn\\\'t picked up on it," said Swann. "As a fellow spinner, I '
             'thought I should have known a bit more about what was going on. '
             'It turned out that no one did apart from Matt Prior.  "There was '
             'shock in the room, but at that stage no one really knew how to '
             "react to mental health problems. I\\'m glad it\\'s talked about "
             'these days, because we were out of our depth."  ### 2015 - '
             "\\'Dejection, disappointment and embarrassment\\'  \\n A defeat "
             "to Bangladesh sealed England\\'s elimination at the Cricket "
             "World Cup 2015  Of all England\\'s World Cup failures, they had "
             'never been further behind the rest than in Australia and New '
             'Zealand.  The warning signs were there in a chaotic build-up '
             'which saw captain Alastair Cook replaced by Eoin Morgan. Even on '
             'the eve of their opening game against Australia, England were '
             'tinkering with their batting order.  "We didn\\\'t know our best '
             "XI, we didn\\'t know who was going to open the batting, who was "
             'batting three and we didn\\\'t know our best bowling attack," '
             'said fast bowler James Anderson.  "There would have been players '
             'the night before not sure whether they were playing, or guys '
             "that hadn\\'t played a lot of cricket in the positions they were "
             'going to be in. Two, three or four players being unsure of what '
             'they are doing is going to have a detrimental effect on the '
             'side."  As the rest of the teams belted the ball to all parts, '
             'England plodded along, suffering huge defeats by Australia, New '
             'Zealand and Sri Lanka.  "We had a new captain trying to put his '
             'stamp on the team at a global event," said Anderson. "He should '
             'have been doing that months or even years in advance. We '
             'didn\\\'t know what sort of team we were.  "We had plans for our '
             "batting that were quite structured, but it just didn\\'t work "
             'for us. We were careful, often in our own shells. Maybe people '
             'were looking after their own games, rather than thinking about '
             'the bigger picture."  Their final chance to make the '
             'quarter-finals, against Bangladesh in Adelaide, ended in perhaps '
             'England\\\'s worst ever World Cup result.  "We didn\\\'t think '
             '\\\'it\\\'s just Bangladesh\\\'," said Anderson. "We were very '
             'conscious of not taking them for granted. We bowled OK and kept '
             'them to a decent total and were in a good position chasing, but '
             'we kept losing wickets and I was last man out. A lack of '
             'confidence beat us.  "We were dejected, disappointed and '
             'embarrassed. We just weren\\\'t good enough."  \\n',

             'commentary, clips and highlights on the BBC Sport website      '
             'With the World Cup almost upon us, it is a sacred duty for us '
             'all, as cricket fans, to help bring the tournament to a wider '
             'consciousness.  What better way to do so than by enrapturing the '
             'non-cricket-aware by dropping key statistics about the 10 World '
             'Cup teams into ordinary conversations during everyday '

             'impress friends, colleagues, relatives, strangers and enemies '
             'alike.  ### Afghanistan  \\n Afghanistan beat West Indies in the '
             'final of the qualifying event for the World Cup   **A quiet '
             'aside on a crowded bus in a seemingly endless traffic jam:** "I '
             "don\\'t want to make a scene while everyone shuffles around "
             'impatiently and pretends to play cribbage on their smartphones, '
             'but it is a provable fact that Afghanistan have more bowlers '
             'ranked in the top 20 in the current ODI rankings - three (Rashid '
             'Khan; Mujeeb Ur Rahman; and Mohammad Nabi) - than Australia, '
             'England, New Zealand (two each), Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh '
             '(one each), or West Indies (none). Only India (four) have more '
             'top-20 ODI bowlers; South Africa also have three. Yes, since you '
             'ask, I am getting off at the next stop."   **Ice-breaker at '
             'awkward family function:** "Here\\\'s something you might be '
             'interested in, Aunty Doris. All-rounder Mohammad Nabi has '
             'represented Afghanistan against 45 different national teams '
             "during his country\\'s rise through the international ranks, "
             'ranging from England, India and Australia, to Bhutan, Uganda and '
             'Italy. He has played against countries beginning with 20 of the '
             '26 letters of the alphabet. He is missing only G, L, R, V, X and '
             'Y from his collection."   **Buying time during police '
             'interrogation:** "Officer, I cannot remember where I was on the '
             'night of the 23rd, but I can remember thinking on the night of '
             'the 23rd that people are underestimating Afghanistan. In the '
             '2018 Asia Cup, they beat Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, pushed '
             'Pakistan to the final over before losing by three wickets, and '
             'tied with India. They also beat West Indies twice in the World '
             'Cup qualifying tournament. If they get a spinning pitch, '
             'anything is possible. Where\\\'s my lawyer?"  ### Australia  \\n '
             'Australia won the World Cup the last time it was held in the UK, '
             "in 1999   **Defusing tension while waiting for the judges\\' "
             'verdict at a cutest puppy competition:** "Yes, it\\\'s always '
             'going to be hard to beat the labrador at something like this, '
             'just as it always used to be hard to beat Australia at Cricket '
             'World Cups. They went unbeaten in 33 World Cup matches in '
             'between group-stage defeats to Pakistan in 1999 and 2011, and '
             'have won four of the last five tournaments."   **Commiserating '
             'with a team-mate after losing another pub quiz:** "We can always '
             'bounce back, Dave - look at the Australian one-day team. As of 5 '
             'March this year, they had lost 22 of their last 26 ODIs. Then '
             'they won three in a row to come from 2-0 down to beat India in '
             'India - a team which had won 17 of its previous 19 home ODI '
             'series, not to mention a home World Cup. Then the Aussies swept '
             'Pakistan in the UAE, 5-0, becoming the first Australian team to '
             'win eight in a row away from home outside a World Cup since '
             '1990. All without their two best batsmen. And several of their '
             'best bowlers. So stop crying, Dave, get back to your '
             'encyclopaedias, put the hours in, and come back stronger. We go '
             'again."  ### Bangladesh  \\n Is Mustafizur Rahman '
             "Bangladesh\\'s trump card?   **Ordering a bottle of cheap "
             'prosecco at a fancy wine bar:** "As I always say, do not '
             'underestimate The Fizz - here, or on the cricket field. '
             "Mustafizur Rahman\\'s form might have been a little patchy since "
             'his extraordinary 11-wickets-in-two-matches entry to the ODI '
             'stage against India in 2015, but he still has the second best '
             '__average (21.6) of the 30 seam bowlers to have taken 40 ODI '
             'wickets since the 2015 World Cup."   **Attending your '
             "grandparents\\' summer gymnastics display at the local nursing "
             'home:** "What we\\\'ve seen today does suggest that, contrary to '
             'often- stated wisdom, there is a substitute for experience. But '
             'do not tell that to the Bangladesh World Cup squad. If '
             'experience is in fact unsubstitutable, they can already book an '
             'open-top bus tour through Dhaka for 16 July. Their captain, '
             'Mashrafe Mortaza, will be the only seamer in the 2019 World Cup '
             'who appeared in the 2003 tournament, and, of the 11 veterans of '
             'the 2007 World Cup who have been named in the squads for 2019, '
             'four are from Bangladesh (Mashrafe, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal '
             'and Mushfiqur Rahim)."  ### England  \\n Jos Buttler (left) has '
             'the second highest strike-rate in one-day cricket history   **On '
             'a speed date:** "If you think this attempted seduction is too '
             "quick, I suggest you avoid watching England\\'s one-day batsmen "
             "scoring centuries. Since the 2015 World Cup, England\\'s ODI "
             'hundreds have taken an average of 88 balls. All other '
             "countries\\' one-day hundreds have a combined average of 102 "
             "balls. In the 2011-2015 World Cup cycle, England\\'s hundreds "
             'averaged 103 balls, in line with the global average. Dinner next '
             'Tuesday? Why not?"   **At a naturist colony:** "We might as well '
             'come to terms with the fact that here at Windy Wobblers '
             'Campsite  & Spa, there is nowhere to hide. It must be like being '
             "an ODI bowler running in to bowl at England\\'s batting line-up. "
             'Since the 2015 World Cup, England have scored at 6.27 per over. '
             'The next fastest scoring of the 2019 World Cup teams is '
             "Australia, at 5.72 per over. England\\'s scoring rate has gone "
             'up by 19% compared to the 2011-15 World Cup cycle period (when '
             'it was 5.27 per over). Collectively, the other 2019 teams have '
             'increased their scoring rate by just 3% (from 5.29 to 5.45). '
             "England\\'s batsmen, like all of us here today, have embraced "
             'the concept of unrestricted freedom. Only one other nation has '
             'achieved a rise of more than 6% in the same period - Pakistan, '
             'up 12% from 4.90 to 5.51."  ### India  \\n Kapil Dev led India '
             'to World Cup glory in England in 1983   **At the opening night '
             'of Charles Darwin - The Musical:** "Adapt to survive - that\\\'s '
             'what the original Chuck D taught us all. And Indian spin bowling '
             'has done exactly that. Since their 2017 Champions Trophy final '
             'defeat to Pakistan, Indian spinners have taken 205 wickets in 54 '
             'matches (average 27.5), with left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep '
             'Yadav and leg-break bowler Yuzvendra Chahal to the fore. Between '
             "the 2015 World Cup and the Champions Trophy final, India\\'s "
             'mostly conventional tweakers had taken 95 wickets in 32 matches '

             'screening of the 2004 blockbuster \\\'Troy\\\':** "No shame '
             'going down there, Brad. All the teams in the 2019 World Cup also '
             "have some kind of Achilles\\' heel. India\\'s could be their "
             'lack of batting depth. Their stellar top three of Rohit Sharma, '
             "Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli have scored 31 of India\\'s 33 "
             "centuries since the 2017 Champions Trophy. India\\'s numbers "
             'four to 11, by contrast, have only the seventh best strike-rate '
             'of the 10 World Cup teams in that period (82 runs per 100 '
             'balls)."   **At a polling station:** "I appreciate and '
             'understand your disillusionment with politics, so why not spoil '
             "your ballot paper by scrawling the words \\'Jasprit Bumrah is an "
             'extraordinary bowling force in the bat-dominated world of '
             "contemporary ODI cricket\\' all over it. Since the 2015 World "
             'Cup, 38 seam bowlers have bowled 150 or more overs in matches '
             "between the 10 teams who will appear at this year\\'s "
             'tournament. Of those 38, Bumrah has the best average (23.7), and '
             'best economy rate (4.61). Vote Bumrah for a more even contest '
             'between bat and ball."  ### New Zealand  \\n Ross Taylor will be '

             'batsman Ross Taylor is. Since the 2015 World Cup, only Virat '
             'Kohli has a better average in ODI cricket - 68.8, and yes, I am '
             'applying a 10-innings minimum to that microplastic-free '

             '"If you think there is a lot of power in that tail, you should '
             'see the New Zealand batting line-up. The Kiwis have had the most '
             'effective lower order this decade in the 50-over format '
             '(although since 2015, England have been even better. Since 2010, '
             "New Zealand\\'s numbers 8 to 11 have collectively averaged 17.5, "
             'with a strike-rate of 91 - both world-leading numbers for the '
             "decade. But yes, they don\\'t have quite as much bite up front "
             'as our reptilian friend here. Since the 2017 Champions Trophy, '
             'New Zealand has the lowest average opening partnership of the 10 '

             'chart pop:** "There are some terrible records here, so '
             "Pakistan\\'s recent results would fit in disappointingly "
             'seamlessly. They won the 2017 Champions Trophy with the most '
             'dominant combined semi-final and final performance in major '
             'cricketing tournament history, but in matches between the 10 '
             'World Cup teams since the start of 2018, Pakistan have the worst '
             'record - won four, lost 21."  **On the international space '
             'station:** "The world looks so calm and peaceful from this '
             'incredible vantage point, even if the food here is at best '
             'disappointing. Who would know from here the unending web of '
             'curiosities that lurks on the surface? For example, the fact '
             'that Pakistan have the second best all-time World Cup win-loss '
             'ratio when batting first (2.36; won 26 lost 11), but only the '
             'eighth best when bowling first (0.78; won 14 lost 18). Yet '
             'outside World Cups, they have a marginally better win-loss ratio '
             'when chasing (1.17; 1.15 batting first). Truly, this is a '
             'universe of mysteries."  ### South Africa  \\n Imran Tahir has '
             'taken 92 wickets for South Africa since the 2015 World Cup   '
             '**After eating a competent takeaway:** "As always, my chicken '
             "chow mein was on time and of a good standard. And that\\'s what "
             'you want - consistent delivery. Take the South African cricket '
             'team - they won more ODIs than they lost in 23 out of 24 '
             'calendar years from 1995 to 2018. The exception was 2004 (won '
             'five lost 12). By comparison, Australia had 19 winning years in '
             'that period, India 18, Sri Lanka 14, England and Pakistan 11, '
             'New Zealand 10, and West Indies eight. Sure, you might not want '
             'the Red Dragon catering for you on a big occasion, but week-in, '
             'week-out, they hit the spot."   **Comforting a trainee vet after '
             'a difficult first day:** "Everyone has times when things '
             "don\\'t work out as well as they\\'d hoped. The South African "
             'ODI batting line-up in 2018 was a classic example - as a team, '
             'they averaged 27.4 runs per wicket, their first sub-30 year '
             'since 1995, having averaged more than 40 in 2015, 2016 and 2017. '
             'But take heart from their example - they have bounced back to '
             'form in 2019, averaging 48.9 per wicket in their first 10 ODIs '
             'this year."  ### Sri Lanka  \\n Dimuth Karunaratne, who has been '
             'appointed Sri Lanka captain for the World Cup, played his first '
             'ODI for four years earlier this month   **Gazing up at the night '
             'sky while on a raft floating in the middle of the Pacific '
             'Ocean:** "The sky seems like an infinite nothingness - very much '
             "like Sri Lanka\\'s hopes of repeating their sensational 1996 "
             'World Cup triumph. If you look closely enough, there is '
             'something there, but it is very, very distant and barely '
             'perceptible to the human eye. Over the last three years, in '
             'matches between the 2019 World Cup teams, Sri Lanka have the '
             'worst win/loss ratio (won 10, lost 45, tied one). Their batsman '
             'have collectively averaged 24.2 (10th out of 10), and scored at '
             '81 runs per 100 balls (seventh). Their bowlers have averaged '
             '43.0 (ninth), and conceded 5.77 per over (10th)."   **Poking '
             'through the crumbling remnants of an ancient vase at an '
             'archaeological dig:** "This isn\\\'t the only thing that '
             "isn\\'t in as good a shape as it used to be. The conveyor belt "
             'of Sri Lankan cricket talent has not so much ground to a halt, '
             'as been decommissioned and sold for scrap. Sri Lanka have played '
             '84 matches since the 2015 World Cup, in which they have selected '
             '55 different players. No other team has used as many different '
             'players in that time. Over the 2011-2015 World Cup cycle, Sri '
             'Lanka used 43 players in 125 matches. Of the 15 players who have '
             'made their ODI debut for Sri Lanka since January 2017, none has '
             'played more than 10 matches, scored more than 150 runs, taken '
             'more than 10 wickets, or been selected for the World Cup."  ### '
             "West Indies  \\n Chris Gayle averaged 106 in West Indies\\' "
             'one-day series loss to England earlier this year   **Comforting '

             '"You have to get used to things suddenly bursting into life. The '
             'West Indies batting line-up, for example. Between the end of the '
             '2015 World Cup, and the start of the ODI series against England '
             "in February this year, West Indies\\' batsmen had collectively "
             'been the second slowest-scoring of the 10 World Cup teams - 78.6 '
             'per 100 balls - and scored only 14 hundreds in 57 matches. In 10 '
             'ODIs since, they have made seven centuries, and scored at 103.99 '

             'contested in the law courts by no fewer than 47 different '
             'deities including Zeus, Odin, and Jose Mourinho), has hit 101 '

             'At the start of his career, it took him 177 ODI innings to hit '

             'once every 78 balls faced."  \\n',

             'With the World Cup almost upon us, it is a sacred duty for us '
             'all, as cricket fans, to help bring the tournament to a wider '
             'consciousness.  What better way to do so than by enrapturing the '
             'non-cricket-aware by dropping key statistics about the 10 World '
             'Cup teams into ordinary conversations during everyday '
             'scenarios.  Here, then, are your Conversational Statsnippets to '
             'impress friends, colleagues, relatives, strangers and enemies '
             'alike.  ### Afghanistan  \\n Afghanistan beat West Indies in the '
             'final of the qualifying event for the World Cup   **A quiet '
             'aside on a crowded bus in a seemingly endless traffic jam:** "I '
             "don\\'t want to make a scene while everyone shuffles around "
             'impatiently and pretends to play cribbage on their smartphones, '
             'but it is a provable fact that Afghanistan have more bowlers '
             'ranked in the top 20 in the current ODI rankings - three (Rashid '
             'Khan; Mujeeb Ur Rahman; and Mohammad Nabi) - than Australia, '
             'England, New Zealand (two each), Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh '
             '(one each), or West Indies (none). Only India (four) have more '
             'top-20 ODI bowlers; South Africa also have three. Yes, since you '
             'ask, I am getting off at the next stop."   **Ice-breaker at '
             'awkward family function:** "Here\\\'s something you might be '
             'interested in, Aunty Doris. All-rounder Mohammad Nabi has '
             'represented Afghanistan against 45 different national teams '
             "during his country\\'s rise through the international ranks, "
             'ranging from England, India and Australia, to Bhutan, Uganda and '
             'Italy. He has played against countries beginning with 20 of the '
             '26 letters of the alphabet. He is missing only G, L, R, V, X and '
             'Y from his collection."   **Buying time during police '
             'interrogation:** "Officer, I cannot remember where I was on the '
             'night of the 23rd, but I can remember thinking on the night of '
             'the 23rd that people are underestimating Afghanistan. In the '
             '2018 Asia Cup, they beat Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, pushed '
             'Pakistan to the final over before losing by three wickets, and '
             'tied with India. They also beat West Indies twice in the World '
             'Cup qualifying tournament. If they get a spinning pitch, '
             'anything is possible. Where\\\'s my lawyer?"  ### Australia  \\n '
             'Australia won the World Cup the last time it was held in the UK, '
             "in 1999   **Defusing tension while waiting for the judges\\' "
             'verdict at a cutest puppy competition:** "Yes, it\\\'s always '
             'going to be hard to beat the labrador at something like this, '
             'just as it always used to be hard to beat Australia at Cricket '
             'World Cups. They went unbeaten in 33 World Cup matches in '
             'between group-stage defeats to Pakistan in 1999 and 2011, and '
             'have won four of the last five tournaments."   **Commiserating '
             'with a team-mate after losing another pub quiz:** "We can always '
             'bounce back, Dave - look at the Australian one-day team. As of 5 '
             'March this year, they had lost 22 of their last 26 ODIs. Then '
             'they won three in a row to come from 2-0 down to beat India in '
             'India - a team which had won 17 of its previous 19 home ODI '
             'series, not to mention a home World Cup. Then the Aussies swept '
             'Pakistan in the UAE, 5-0, becoming the first Australian team to '
             'win eight in a row away from home outside a World Cup since '
             '1990. All without their two best batsmen. And several of their '
             'best bowlers. So stop crying, Dave, get back to your '
             'encyclopaedias, put the hours in, and come back stronger. We go '
             'again."  ### Bangladesh  \\n Is Mustafizur Rahman '

             'underestimate The Fizz - here, or on the cricket field. '
             "Mustafizur Rahman\\'s form might have been a little patchy since "
             'his extraordinary 11-wickets-in-two-matches entry to the ODI '
             'stage against India in 2015, but he still has the second best '
             '__average (21.6) of the 30 seam bowlers to have taken 40 ODI '
             'wickets since the 2015 World Cup."   **Attending your '
             "grandparents\\' summer gymnastics display at the local nursing "
             'home:** "What we\\\'ve seen today does suggest that, contrary to '
             'often- stated wisdom, there is a substitute for experience. But '
             'do not tell that to the Bangladesh World Cup squad. If '
             'experience is in fact unsubstitutable, they can already book an '
             'open-top bus tour through Dhaka for 16 July. Their captain, '
             'Mashrafe Mortaza, will be the only seamer in the 2019 World Cup '
             'who appeared in the 2003 tournament, and, of the 11 veterans of '
             'the 2007 World Cup who have been named in the squads for 2019, '
             'four are from Bangladesh (Mashrafe, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal '
             'and Mushfiqur Rahim)."  ### England  \\n Jos Buttler (left) has '
             'the second highest strike-rate in one-day cricket history   **On '
             'a speed date:** "If you think this attempted seduction is too '
             "quick, I suggest you avoid watching England\\'s one-day batsmen "
             "scoring centuries. Since the 2015 World Cup, England\\'s ODI "
             'hundreds have taken an average of 88 balls. All other '
             "countries\\' one-day hundreds have a combined average of 102 "
             "balls. In the 2011-2015 World Cup cycle, England\\'s hundreds "
             'averaged 103 balls, in line with the global average. Dinner next '
             'Tuesday? Why not?"   **At a naturist colony:** "We might as well '
             'come to terms with the fact that here at Windy Wobblers '
             'Campsite  & Spa, there is nowhere to hide. It must be like being '
             "an ODI bowler running in to bowl at England\\'s batting line-up. "
             'Since the 2015 World Cup, England have scored at 6.27 per over. '
             'The next fastest scoring of the 2019 World Cup teams is '
             "Australia, at 5.72 per over. England\\'s scoring rate has gone "
             'up by 19% compared to the 2011-15 World Cup cycle period (when '
             'it was 5.27 per over). Collectively, the other 2019 teams have '
             'increased their scoring rate by just 3% (from 5.29 to 5.45). '
             "England\\'s batsmen, like all of us here today, have embraced "
             'the concept of unrestricted freedom. Only one other nation has '
             'achieved a rise of more than 6% in the same period - Pakistan, '
             'up 12% from 4.90 to 5.51."  ### India  \\n Kapil Dev led India '
             'to World Cup glory in England in 1983   **At the opening night '
             'of Charles Darwin - The Musical:** "Adapt to survive - that\\\'s '
             'what the original Chuck D taught us all. And Indian spin bowling '

             'defeat to Pakistan, Indian spinners have taken 205 wickets in 54 '
             'matches (average 27.5), with left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep '

             "Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli have scored 31 of India\\'s 33 "
             "centuries since the 2017 Champions Trophy. India\\'s numbers "

             "between the 10 teams who will appear at this year\\'s "
             'tournament. Of those 38, Bumrah has the best average (23.7), and '
             'best economy rate (4.61). Vote Bumrah for a more even contest '

             'when chasing (1.17; 1.15 batting first). Truly, this is a '
             'universe of mysteries."  ### South Africa  \\n Imran Tahir has '
             'taken 92 wickets for South Africa since the 2015 World Cup   '
             '**After eating a competent takeaway:** "As always, my chicken '
             "chow mein was on time and of a good standard. And that\\'s what "
             'you want - consistent delivery. Take the South African cricket '
             'team - they won more ODIs than they lost in 23 out of 24 '
             'calendar years from 1995 to 2018. The exception was 2004 (won '
             'five lost 12). By comparison, Australia had 19 winning years in '
             'that period, India 18, Sri Lanka 14, England and Pakistan 11, '
             'New Zealand 10, and West Indies eight. Sure, you might not want '
             'the Red Dragon catering for you on a big occasion, but week-in, '
             'week-out, they hit the spot."   **Comforting a trainee vet after '
             'a difficult first day:** "Everyone has times when things '
             "don\\'t work out as well as they\\'d hoped. The South African "
             'ODI batting line-up in 2018 was a classic example - as a team, '
             'they averaged 27.4 runs per wicket, their first sub-30 year '
             'since 1995, having averaged more than 40 in 2015, 2016 and 2017. '
             'But take heart from their example - they have bounced back to '
             'form in 2019, averaging 48.9 per wicket in their first 10 ODIs '
             'this year."  ### Sri Lanka  \\n Dimuth Karunaratne, who has been '
             'appointed Sri Lanka captain for the World Cup, played his first '
             'ODI for four years earlier this month   **Gazing up at the night '
             'sky while on a raft floating in the middle of the Pacific '
             'Ocean:** "The sky seems like an infinite nothingness - very much '
             "like Sri Lanka\\'s hopes of repeating their sensational 1996 "
             'World Cup triumph. If you look closely enough, there is '
             'something there, but it is very, very distant and barely '
             'perceptible to the human eye. Over the last three years, in '
             'matches between the 2019 World Cup teams, Sri Lanka have the '
             'worst win/loss ratio (won 10, lost 45, tied one). Their batsman '
             'have collectively averaged 24.2 (10th out of 10), and scored at '
             '81 runs per 100 balls (seventh). Their bowlers have averaged '
             '43.0 (ninth), and conceded 5.77 per over (10th)."   **Poking '
             'through the crumbling remnants of an ancient vase at an '
             'archaeological dig:** "This isn\\\'t the only thing that '
             "isn\\'t in as good a shape as it used to be. The conveyor belt "
             'of Sri Lankan cricket talent has not so much ground to a halt, '
             'as been decommissioned and sold for scrap. Sri Lanka have played '
             '84 matches since the 2015 World Cup, in which they have selected '
             '55 different players. No other team has used as many different '
             'players in that time. Over the 2011-2015 World Cup cycle, Sri '
             'Lanka used 43 players in 125 matches. Of the 15 players who have '
             'made their ODI debut for Sri Lanka since January 2017, none has '
             'played more than 10 matches, scored more than 150 runs, taken '
             'more than 10 wickets, or been selected for the World Cup."  ### '
             "West Indies  \\n Chris Gayle averaged 106 in West Indies\\' "
             'one-day series loss to England earlier this year   **Comforting '
             'a terrified child after a ride on a ghost train at a fun fair:** '
             '"You have to get used to things suddenly bursting into life. The '
             'West Indies batting line-up, for example. Between the end of the '
             '2015 World Cup, and the start of the ODI series against England '
             "in February this year, West Indies\\' batsmen had collectively "
             'been the second slowest-scoring of the 10 World Cup teams - 78.6 '
             'per 100 balls - and scored only 14 hundreds in 57 matches. In 10 '
             'ODIs since, they have made seven centuries, and scored at 103.99 '
             'runs per 100 balls."   **Waiting for a rescue helicopter when '
             'stranded on a desert island:** "Watching Chris Gayle bat has '
             'taught me a valuable lesson in life - always keep one eye on the '
             'sky. The self-proclaimed Universe Boss (a title being vigorously '
             'contested in the law courts by no fewer than 47 different '
             'deities including Zeus, Odin, and Jose Mourinho), has hit 101 '
             'sixes in his last 23 innings, at a rate of one every 10 balls. '
             'At the start of his career, it took him 177 ODI innings to hit '
             'his first 100 sixes, at which point he had cleared the ropes '
             'once every 78 balls faced."  \\n',

             '**Dates:** 30 May - 14 July, 2019    **Live coverage:** '
             'Ball-by-ball commentary on Test Match Special, plus text '
             'commentary, clips and highlights on the BBC Sport website      '
             "England\\'s one-day team has enjoyed a dramatic transformation "
             'since their embarrassing exit from the 2015 World Cup in '
             'Australia.  From no-hopers to world beaters, they go into this '
             "summer\\'s World Cup, which starts on Thursday, as hosts and "
             'favourites.  Captain Eoin Morgan is credited as being one of the '
             'key men behind the reversal in fortunes. Here, he describes '
             "England\\'s four-year journey to former England skipper Michael "
             "Vaughan.  Listen to the full interview on Test Match Special\\'s "
             "World Cup daily podcast.  ### \\'We were humiliated\\'  \\n Eoin "
             "Morgan said he was \\'humiliated\\' by the manner of England\\'s "
             'exit in 2015   _In 2015, in a tournament all-but designed to '
             "ensure progression for all of the world\\'s leading nations to "
             'the last eight, England failed to make it past the group stage - '
             'only managing to beat Scotland and Afghanistan. Their fate was '
             'sealed by a defeat by Bangladesh, after particularly heavy '
             'losses to New Zealand, Australia and Sri Lanka._   **Morgan:** '
             '"We were humiliated. There are two games which stand out for me '
             'in that World Cup which confirmed we were underprepared and so '
             'far off the mark - the first one being against New Zealand. We '
             'were bowled out for 123 and New Zealand knocked them off in 12.2 '
             'overs.  "The second moment was that game against Bangladesh. We '
             'were chasing 275, and we were more than capable of chasing it '
             'down - it was on a good wicket and against Bangladesh, who we '
             'had beaten previously in one-day series.  "When it came to every '
             'crunch moment in the chase, however, we fell short. We '
             'crumbled."  ### The phone call that changed English cricket '
             'forever?  \\n Former England director of cricket Andrew Strauss '
             "shared Morgan\\'s vision for revitalising England\\'s one-day "
             'team   _Following the World Cup, England replaced head coach '
             'Peter Moores with Trevor Bayliss. However, they stuck by their '
             'captain..._   **Morgan:** "Being given the opportunity to '
             'continue leading the side allowed me to reaffirm ideas I had '
             'during the 2015 World Cup.  "We recognised we were so far off '
             'the mark, needed to change the way we played and needed to have '
             'one clear goal as a team.  "The phone call from [England '
             'director of cricket] Andrew Strauss was a huge confidence '
             'booster for me. He gave me absolute clarity that we needed to '
             'change things drastically and he would give us time to change '
             'them.  "In the 2015 World Cup, there was a drastic change in the '
             'move towards higher scores. Scores moved from 300 to 330 on '
             "average and that meant you had to change everyone\\'s default "
             'mode.  "As a group, we\\\'d been together for a long time and '
             'played the same cricket. When we were put under pressure we '
             'would go into our shell and be unable to play any shots."  ### '
             'Ripping it all up and starting again  \\n Since 2018, Jason Roy, '
             'pictured, and Jonny Bairstow have scored the most century '
             "opening partnerships in ODI cricket   _England\\'s personnel "
             'changed dramatically as they brought in the likes of Jason Roy, '
             'Jonny Bairstow, Adil Rashid and Liam Plunkett for their first '
             'home series after the World Cup._   **Morgan:** "Our strongest '
             'point was our bowlers - Anderson, Broad and Tredwell were '
             "awesome - but, unfortunately, the 50-over game wasn\\'t lending "
             'itself to that kind of bowling.  "With the bat, you needed to be '
             'able to post 330-350, so to choose guys whose default mode was '
             'pure aggression was something we highlighted in selection.  "We '
             'identified guys with a lot of talent who would fit the mould; '
             'guys who if they did get knocked back at some stage, they would '
             'come back harder.  "One of the major things that came into '
             "consideration was people\\'s capacity to continue to learn and "
             'get better: guys who would be potentially be coming into their '
             'peak in four years\\\' time.  "It all stemmed from Strauss. In '
             'the first selection meeting we had, he gave absolute clarity and '
             "clear direction. He emphasised that Test cricket wasn\\'t going "
             'to be the only priority over the next four years and that '
             'white-ball cricket would take a front seat."  ### \\\'We were '
             "jealous of them\\' - tapping into the New Zealand model  \\n "
             'Brendon McCullum took New Zealand to the final of the World Cup '
             "in 2015   _England\\'s first series was against New Zealand, who "
             'had reached the World Cup final by playing fearless, aggressive '
             'cricket. England took a similar approach and the improvement was '
             'instant as they posted 408-9 in the first match. High scores '
             'soon became the norm._   **Morgan:** "One of the best pieces of '
             'advice I got when I was given the captaincy was to be myself. I '
             'have played against and am very good friends with [former New '
             'Zealand skipper] Brendon McCullum.  "If you look at his body '
             "language at any stage of any game it\\'s extremely positive, "
             "he\\'s always on the front foot and leading from the front "
             'regardless of the scoreboard or the situation of the game. I '
             "like to pick his brain. As a pure leader, he\\'s exceptional.  "
             '"New Zealand had embodied playing fun cricket under McCullum. '
             'Playing against them, we were a little bit jealous.  "We '
             "weren\\'t enjoying our cricket and that was something we wanted "
             'to change. Transforming your game from an average-scoring side '
             'to one who scored 350 or 400 is extremely exciting and fun to be '
             'part of.  "Throughout the first couple of years as a side, none '
             'of the talk was results based. The talk in the dressing room was '
             'about changing our method.  "We had to accept it would take time '
             'and develop trust by selecting players continuously, providing '
             'they played for the team with that one goal of trying to win the '
             'game with the bat or ball. If guys went for runs with the ball, '
             'as long as they stuck to trying to get wickets they would '
             'continue to be selected.  "That has been worth its weight in '
             'gold because it has developed a lot of trust between the coach, '
             'captain and the players."  ### Not touring Bangladesh  \\n Jos '
             "Buttler captained England in Eoin Morgan\\'s absence in "
             'Bangladesh   _As England swept all before them, all seemed well. '
             'Morgan, however, was criticised for_deciding not to tour '
             'Bangladesh in 2016 _over safety concerns._   **Morgan:** "It was '
             "a difficult decision and one I didn\\'t find easy to make. I "
             'thought of all the consequences - losing the captaincy, being '
             'dropped and English cricket going in a different direction - and '
             'I came back to the advice I was given about being true to '
             'myself.  "If I had gone and didn\\\'t feel safe to go and '
             "perform in an England shirt, it wouldn\\'t have sat well with me "
             'and would have rubbed off on the other players.  "Since then, '
             'everyone within the group has accepted that was my decision. '
             "I\\'m a guy of strong principles and I think people respect "
             'that."  ### \\\'A reminder of how bad things were\\\' - '
             "Morgan\\'s diary  \\n England have not lost a one-day series "
             'since defeat to India in early 2017   _England displaced India '
             'as the number one ODI side in the world in May 2018, reaching '
             'the Champions Trophy semi-final in 2017 along the way. They have '
             'held on to that position ever since. Morgan, however, is keen '
             'not to forget where they came from._   **Morgan:** "I have a '
             "diary and a lot of it is about the team. It\\'s about what makes "
             'people tick.  "I want to continually make players better people '
             "and cricketers. To do that you have to make notes. You can\\'t "
             'remember every single thing.  "The things I look back on '
             'constantly are the lessons I learned from 2015. It reminds me of '
             'how bad things were and how good things are now.  "One of the '
             "important things as a captain or coach is knowing what\\'s going "
             'on around you, and knowing the right thing to say at the right '
             'time.  "Depending on the mood, it might not be to say anything. '
             'A good horse trainer lets his horse go out and run. The jockey '
             'steers it but the horse has to run the race. But if something '
             'needs to be said, it\\\'ll be said."  ### A visit from Gareth '
             "Southgate  \\n Gareth Southgate led England\\'s men\\'s football "
             'team to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2018   _England are '
             'heavy favourites heading into the World Cup and among the things '
             'they have done off the field to deal with the pressure is ask '
             "England\\'s men\\'s football manager Gareth Southgate to talk to "
             'the squad._   **Morgan:** "It\\\'s a huge opportunity for us '
             "this summer and I don\\'t think it is pressured. Everywhere we "
             'have been for the past two or three years - tough places like '
             "Australia and India away - we\\'ve been favourites. If guys "
             "didn\\'t enjoy being favourites, it would become pressure. I see "
             'it as opportunity.  "Gareth Southgate came to talk to us for a '
             'couple of hours recently, and he was outstanding.  "He talked us '
             'through his journey as manager during the World Cup and where '
             'England were striving to be.  "For a lot of our players it '
             'resonated with exactly what they are going through at the '
             'moment, because that was us three, four years ago - trying to '
             'get to the stage where we went into a major tournament as '
             'favourites.  "He talked about pressure and opportunity: '
             'ultimately, pressure is self imposed.  "As a child you dream of '
             'scoring 100 in a Test match or hitting the winning runs in a '
             'World Cup final. I never dreamed I would captain England in a '
             'home World Cup.  "It\\\'s such a privileged position to be in. I '
             'think I\\\'m one of the luckiest people in the world."  \\n',

             'soon became the norm._   **Morgan:** "One of the best pieces of '
             'advice I got when I was given the captaincy was to be myself. I '
             'have played against and am very good friends with [former New '
             'Zealand skipper] Brendon McCullum.  "If you look at his body '
             "language at any stage of any game it\\'s extremely positive, "
             "he\\'s always on the front foot and leading from the front "
             'regardless of the scoreboard or the situation of the game. I '
             "like to pick his brain. As a pure leader, he\\'s exceptional.  "
             '"New Zealand had embodied playing fun cricket under McCullum. '
             'Playing against them, we were a little bit jealous.  "We '
             "weren\\'t enjoying our cricket and that was something we wanted "
             'to change. Transforming your game from an average-scoring side '
             'to one who scored 350 or 400 is extremely exciting and fun to be '
             'part of.  "Throughout the first couple of years as a side, none '
             'of the talk was results based. The talk in the dressing room was '
             'about changing our method.  "We had to accept it would take time '
             'and develop trust by selecting players continuously, providing '
             'they played for the team with that one goal of trying to win the '
             'game with the bat or ball. If guys went for runs with the ball, '
             'as long as they stuck to trying to get wickets they would '
             'continue to be selected.  "That has been worth its weight in '
             'gold because it has developed a lot of trust between the coach, '
             'captain and the players."  ### Not touring Bangladesh  \\n Jos '
             "Buttler captained England in Eoin Morgan\\'s absence in "
             'Bangladesh   _As England swept all before them, all seemed well. '
             'Morgan, however, was criticised for_deciding not to tour '
             'Bangladesh in 2016 _over safety concerns._   **Morgan:** "It was '
             "a difficult decision and one I didn\\'t find easy to make. I "
             'thought of all the consequences - losing the captaincy, being '
             'dropped and English cricket going in a different direction - and '
             'I came back to the advice I was given about being true to '
             'myself.  "If I had gone and didn\\\'t feel safe to go and '
             "perform in an England shirt, it wouldn\\'t have sat well with me "
             'and would have rubbed off on the other players.  "Since then, '
             'everyone within the group has accepted that was my decision. '
             "I\\'m a guy of strong principles and I think people respect "
             'that."  ### \\\'A reminder of how bad things were\\\' - '
             "Morgan\\'s diary  \\n England have not lost a one-day series "
             'since defeat to India in early 2017   _England displaced India '
             'as the number one ODI side in the world in May 2018, reaching '
             'the Champions Trophy semi-final in 2017 along the way. They have '
             'held on to that position ever since. Morgan, however, is keen '
             'not to forget where they came from._   **Morgan:** "I have a '
             "diary and a lot of it is about the team. It\\'s about what makes "
             'people tick.  "I want to continually make players better people '
             "and cricketers. To do that you have to make notes. You can\\'t "
             'remember every single thing.  "The things I look back on '
             'constantly are the lessons I learned from 2015. It reminds me of '
             'how bad things were and how good things are now.  "One of the '
             "important things as a captain or coach is knowing what\\'s going "
             'on around you, and knowing the right thing to say at the right '
             'time.  "Depending on the mood, it might not be to say anything. '
             'A good horse trainer lets his horse go out and run. The jockey '
             'steers it but the horse has to run the race. But if something '
             'needs to be said, it\\\'ll be said."  ### A visit from Gareth '
             "Southgate  \\n Gareth Southgate led England\\'s men\\'s football "
             'team to the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2018   _England are '
             'heavy favourites heading into the World Cup and among the things '
             'they have done off the field to deal with the pressure is ask '
             "England\\'s men\\'s football manager Gareth Southgate to talk to "
             'the squad._   **Morgan:** "It\\\'s a huge opportunity for us '
             "this summer and I don\\'t think it is pressured. Everywhere we "
             'have been for the past two or three years - tough places like '
             "Australia and India away - we\\'ve been favourites. If guys "
             "didn\\'t enjoy being favourites, it would become pressure. I see "
             'it as opportunity.  "Gareth Southgate came to talk to us for a '
             'couple of hours recently, and he was outstanding.  "He talked us '
             'through his journey as manager during the World Cup and where '
             'England were striving to be.  "For a lot of our players it '
             'resonated with exactly what they are going through at the '
             'moment, because that was us three, four years ago - trying to '
             'get to the stage where we went into a major tournament as '
             'favourites.  "He talked about pressure and opportunity: '
             'ultimately, pressure is self imposed.  "As a child you dream of '
             'scoring 100 in a Test match or hitting the winning runs in a '
             'World Cup final. I never dreamed I would captain England in a '
             'home World Cup.  "It\\\'s such a privileged position to be in. I '
             'think I\\\'m one of the luckiest people in the world."  \\n',

             'and think at the last minute to bowl a googly or whatever, but '
             'it is more of an in-the-moment thing.   **Buttler: How do you '

             'of cricket and being a spinner - you are going to get hit for '

             'other way but I actually enjoy the challenge; you can always '
             'change the game in a couple of balls.  Even if there are two '

             'There are times you may get smashed for 30 but it is having the '

             'You take it on board, but as a spinner you have to go with your '

             'as I got older. When I was younger if I got hit for six I could '

 'newsText': '\\n \\n  The England and Wales Cricket Board has agreed a new '
             'deal with BBC Sport to broadcast ball-by-ball radio commentary '
             'on international cricket until 2019.  The six-year-deal will see '
             "BBC radio provide live and exclusive coverage of all England\\'s "
             'home Tests, one-day internationals and Twenty20s.  The deal '
             'covers the Australian tours in 2015 and 2019 and the visits of '
             'India in 2014 and South Africa in 2017.  "This is excellent news '
             'for cricket lovers," said ECB chief David Collier.  "Test Match '
             'Special (TMS) brings cricket into millions of homes in this '
             'country each summer and is widely recognised for its unique and '
             'world-class coverage of cricket.  "Test Match Special\\\'s '
             'coverage, together with the regular summaries and updates '
             'provided by BBC Radio 5 live, will play a significant role in '
             'promoting cricket from the playground to the Test arena."  '
             'Barbara Slater, Director BBC Sport added: "We\\\'re delighted to '
             'be taking cricket on the radio forward for a further six years.  '
             '## DID YOU KNOW?  Test Match Special was first broadcast in May '
             '1957 on the opening day of the first Test between England and '
             'West Indies at Edgbaston, with commentary from Rex Alston, John '
             'Arlott, EW Swanton and Ken Ablack  "Test Match Special, now in '
             'its 55th year, is one of the most treasured programmes on the '
             'BBC, with its unique mix of expert commentary, insight, humour '
             'and entertainment.  "In a new digital era, the programme and its '
             'accompanying download have never been more popular with its '
             'audience."  The BBC\\\'s current deal was due to expire at the '
             'end of the 2013 season.  Meanwhile, ECB chairman Giles Clarke '
             'has claimed that illegal streaming of coverage of matches is the '
             '"biggest danger to cricket".  He warned that pirate websites '
             'showing games live on the internet threaten broadcasting rights '
             'deals, which bring huge revenues into the game.  Clarke told '
             'TMS: "There are a huge number of pirate websites streaming '
             'cricket on the internet taken from television broadcasts.  "We '
             "and our broadcasters closed down 700 during last summer\\'s "
             'series against India.  "It\\\'s an extremely complex procedure '
             'but it can be done and it has to be done.  "That is the biggest '
             'danger to cricket, because they take money out of the game '
             'without commercial benefit to us.  "They are being used by the '
             'bookmakers as well. The problem of pirate site streaming is very '
             'big for sport."  \\n',

             'deal with BBC Sport to broadcast ball-by-ball radio commentary '
             'on international cricket until 2019.  The six-year-deal will see '
             "BBC radio provide live and exclusive coverage of all England\\'s "
             'home Tests, one-day internationals and Twenty20s.  The deal '
             'covers the Australian tours in 2015 and 2019 and the visits of '
             'India in 2014 and South Africa in 2017.  "This is excellent news '
             'for cricket lovers," said ECB chief David Collier.  "Test Match '
             'Special (TMS) brings cricket into millions of homes in this '
             'country each summer and is widely recognised for its unique and '
             'world-class coverage of cricket.  "Test Match Special\\\'s '
             'coverage, together with the regular summaries and updates '
             'provided by BBC Radio 5 live, will play a significant role in '
             'promoting cricket from the playground to the Test arena."  '
             'Barbara Slater, Director BBC Sport added: "We\\\'re delighted to '
             'be taking cricket on the radio forward for a further six years.  '
             '## DID YOU KNOW?  Test Match Special was first broadcast in May '
             '1957 on the opening day of the first Test between England and '
             'West Indies at Edgbaston, with commentary from Rex Alston, John '
             'Arlott, EW Swanton and Ken Ablack  "Test Match Special, now in '
             'its 55th year, is one of the most treasured programmes on the '
             'BBC, with its unique mix of expert commentary, insight, humour '
             'and entertainment.  "In a new digital era, the programme and its '
             'accompanying download have never been more popular with its '
             'audience."  The BBC\\\'s current deal was due to expire at the '
             'end of the 2013 season.  Meanwhile, ECB chairman Giles Clarke '
             'has claimed that illegal streaming of coverage of matches is the '
             '"biggest danger to cricket".  He warned that pirate websites '
             'showing games live on the internet threaten broadcasting rights '
             'deals, which bring huge revenues into the game.  Clarke told '
             'TMS: "There are a huge number of pirate websites streaming '
             'cricket on the internet taken from television broadcasts.  "We '
             "and our broadcasters closed down 700 during last summer\\'s "
             'series against India.  "It\\\'s an extremely complex procedure '
             'but it can be done and it has to be done.  "That is the biggest '
             'danger to cricket, because they take money out of the game '
             'without commercial benefit to us.  "They are being used by the '
             'bookmakers as well. The problem of pirate site streaming is very '
             'big for sport."  \\n',

             'English international and domestic cricket will be shown live on '
             'BBC TV for the first time in 21 years from 2020.  In a five-year '
             'deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), more than '
             '100 hours of cricket will be broadcast each summer.  The '
             "contract includes live TV coverage of England men and women\\'s "
             "Twenty20 internationals and the ECB\\'s new men\\'s domestic T20 "
             "tournament.  TV highlights of England men\\'s home Tests, "
             'one-day internationals and T20s will also be shown.  The BBC, '
             "which this year celebrates Test Match Special\\'s 60th birthday, "
             'also retained radio rights and digital clips for English '
             'cricket.  Digital clips mean in-play video action clips and '
             'short-form highlights on the BBC Sport website and app for all '
             'England internationals and domestic games.  The BBC last '
             'broadcast live televised cricket in 1999 and the sport has not '
             'been available on free-to-air TV since the 2005 Ashes series, '
             'shown on Channel 4.  "It\\\'s long been our ambition to bring '
             'live cricket back to BBC television," said BBC director general '
             'Tony Hall. "I\\\'m thrilled to see that ambition realised.  '
             '"Cricket is an integral part of the British summer and the BBC '
             "will be putting its full weight behind the nation\\'s favourite "

             '13-team ODI league, introduced from 2021, will now be used to '
