             'year as production of the Sigma engine for Ford is due to end.  '

             'the bulk of that vote, not the Liberal Democrats.  Plus, she '

             'EU - while simultaneously preparing to give Scotland the choice '
             'of pursuing independence.  She was not prepared, she said, to '
             'see Scotland "sink" with that less than sea-worthy vessel, HMS '
             'Brexit.  Still, nothing if not polite. Ms Sturgeon prefaced this '
             'attack by thanking Mr Rennie profusely for confirming that the '
             'SNP had won the European elections.  Team Sturgeon whooped in '
             'delight, banging their desks. Team Rennie, more compact but '

             'and Labour studiously avoided the topics of Brexit and '
             "independence.  Well, wouldn\\'t you, if your party had been "
             'quite so comprehensively gubbed in the European Elections?  To '
             'be fair, both Ruth Davidson and Richard Leonard pursued valid, '
             'salient topics - and pursued them with vigour.  For the Tories, '
             'Ms Davidson cited statistics to the effect that hospital waiting '
             'time targets were routinely being breached.  Ms Davidson went '
             "further. She wanted the FM to put the health secretary\\'s job "

             'Sturgeon is eager for the hospital figures to improve. But she '
             'is also a paid-up member of the Former Health Secretaries '
             'League, Edinburgh Chapter.  So, wisely, she side-stepped the '
             "putative challenge to her chum\\'s tenure in office, confining "
             'her remarks to an insistence that things were improving, while '
             "still difficult.  Labour\\'s Richard Leonard has had a rough "
             'week. Dreadful results in the European elections were followed '
             'by a double resignation from his front bench.  Still, he '
             'rebounded from these troubles to pursue the first minister over '
             'the fate of the workforce at the Caledonian railway works in '
             'Glasgow. His intent was serious, his demeanour equally so.  In '
             'practice, he prised little from the FM who noted that her '
             'government stood ready to help, if and where possible. But his '
             'vigorous approach drew solemn support from his backbenches.  \\n',

             'Nicola Sturgeon had as little time for Edna as she did for '
             'Willie Rennie\\n \\n \\n \\n  Now Ms Sturgeon was not about to '
             'put up with this from Willie Rennie, or his alter ego.  Yes, she '
             'said, parties supporting Remain had been to the fore in the '
             'European elections in Scotland. But it was the SNP who mustered '
             'the bulk of that vote, not the Liberal Democrats.  Plus, she '
             'said, it was entirely valid to argue for the UK remaining in the '
             'EU - while simultaneously preparing to give Scotland the choice '
             'of pursuing independence.  She was not prepared, she said, to '
             'see Scotland "sink" with that less than sea-worthy vessel, HMS '
             'Brexit.  Still, nothing if not polite. Ms Sturgeon prefaced this '
             'attack by thanking Mr Rennie profusely for confirming that the '
             'SNP had won the European elections.  Team Sturgeon whooped in '
             'delight, banging their desks. Team Rennie, more compact but '
             'still enthusiastic, sat in dignified silence, their muse mute.  '

             'and Labour studiously avoided the topics of Brexit and '
             "independence.  Well, wouldn\\'t you, if your party had been "
             'quite so comprehensively gubbed in the European Elections?  To '
             'be fair, both Ruth Davidson and Richard Leonard pursued valid, '
             'salient topics - and pursued them with vigour.  For the Tories, '
             'Ms Davidson cited statistics to the effect that hospital waiting '
             'time targets were routinely being breached.  Ms Davidson went '
             "further. She wanted the FM to put the health secretary\\'s job "
             "on the line if the stats didn\\'t improve by October.  Now Ms "
             'Sturgeon is eager for the hospital figures to improve. But she '
             'is also a paid-up member of the Former Health Secretaries '
             'League, Edinburgh Chapter.  So, wisely, she side-stepped the '
             "putative challenge to her chum\\'s tenure in office, confining "
             'her remarks to an insistence that things were improving, while '
             "still difficult.  Labour\\'s Richard Leonard has had a rough "
             'week. Dreadful results in the European elections were followed '
             'by a double resignation from his front bench.  Still, he '
             'rebounded from these troubles to pursue the first minister over '
             'the fate of the workforce at the Caledonian railway works in '
             'Glasgow. His intent was serious, his demeanour equally so.  In '
             'practice, he prised little from the FM who noted that her '
             'government stood ready to help, if and where possible. But his '
             'vigorous approach drew solemn support from his backbenches.  \\n',

             'but they followed a series of attacks on transgender service by '
             'Congressional Republicans.  Among them, Vicky Hartzler, '
             'Republican for Missouri, introduced an amendment to the '
             'near-$700bn armed forces funding bill - currently before '
             'congress - which sought to bar any military funds from being '
             'used for transgender medical care.  The amendment narrowly '
             "failed, but Mr Trump\\'s tweets echoed Ms Hartzler in citing "
             'supposedly burdensome costs of transgender medical care - a '
             'concern which has riled Republican lawmakers.  An authoritative '
             '2016 study by the Rand Corporation suggests the concern is '
             'unfounded. The study estimated that transgender health care '
             'costs for the estimated 2,450 active duty transgender troops '
             'would increase the health budget by between $2.4m and $8.4m '
             'annually - just 0.04% to 0.13% of the overall healthcare '
             'budget.  By comparison, the Pentagon spends about $84m annually '
             'on erectile dysfunction medication, according to a Military '
             'Times analysis \\- 10 times the upper estimate for transgender '
             'related costs.  Many active duty service members are already '
             'undergoing medical care related to transition. Sergeant Ochoa '
             'receives hormone therapy from his army physician, and was '
             'anticipating having a hysterectomy to lower the risk of cervical '
             'cancer created by testosterone.  It was unclear on Wednesday '
             'whether he would be able to continue with his treatment through '
             'the army, whether he would be forced to revert to female dress '
             'regulations, or if he could continue his army career at all.  '
             '"The thought of going back to serving as someone I\\\'m not... '
             "It\\'s just not something I could do and stay true to my "
             'character," he said.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '

             'LGBT advocacy groups were blindsided, and outraged, by the '
             'president\\\'s sudden announcement.  "This is a despicable '
             'assault on transgender troops who have been serving openly for '
             'more than a year," said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm '
             'Centre, a think tank which studies gender and sexuality in the '
             'military.  "You can\\\'t force people to go back in the closet, '
             "and you can\\'t force them to serve on the basis of a lie if "
             "they\\'ve already been honest about their identity. It\\'s "
             "unworkable for the troops and it\\'s unworkable for the "
             'military, and it will compromise military readiness."  Matthew '
             'Thorn, executive director of OutServe, warned that discharging '
             'thousands of active duty troops would would cause chaos and '
             'resentment.  "The most important thing for service members is '
             'that the person sitting on their right and their left has their '
             'back, particularly in a wartime situation," he said. "When you '
             "start stripping away those people, that\\'s what disrupts unit "
             'cohesion."  For those actively serving, who came out as '
             'transgender with an understanding from their commanders, and '
             'from President Obama, that they would no longer be discriminated '
             'against, the future is once again clouded by prejudice.  For '
             'Sergeant Ochoa, the only sensible response was to put on his '
             'dress blues, go to his graduation ceremony, and keep doing his '
             'job.  "The only thing I can do is carry on as best as I can, '
             'continue to be a professional and a drill sergeant to the best '
             'of my ability, and do that for as long as I have the '
             'opportunity," he said.  \\n',

             'Congressional Republicans.  Among them, Vicky Hartzler, '
             'Republican for Missouri, introduced an amendment to the '
             'near-$700bn armed forces funding bill - currently before '

             'supposedly burdensome costs of transgender medical care - a '
             'concern which has riled Republican lawmakers.  An authoritative '
             '2016 study by the Rand Corporation suggests the concern is '
             'unfounded. The study estimated that transgender health care '
             'costs for the estimated 2,450 active duty transgender troops '
             'would increase the health budget by between $2.4m and $8.4m '
             'annually - just 0.04% to 0.13% of the overall healthcare '
             'budget.  By comparison, the Pentagon spends about $84m annually '
             'on erectile dysfunction medication, according to a Military '
             'Times analysis \\- 10 times the upper estimate for transgender '
             'related costs.  Many active duty service members are already '
             'undergoing medical care related to transition. Sergeant Ochoa '
             'receives hormone therapy from his army physician, and was '
             'anticipating having a hysterectomy to lower the risk of cervical '
             'cancer created by testosterone.  It was unclear on Wednesday '
             'whether he would be able to continue with his treatment through '
             'the army, whether he would be forced to revert to female dress '
             'regulations, or if he could continue his army career at all.  '
             '"The thought of going back to serving as someone I\\\'m not... '
             "It\\'s just not something I could do and stay true to my "

             'LGBT advocacy groups were blindsided, and outraged, by the '

             'assault on transgender troops who have been serving openly for '
             'more than a year," said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm '
             'Centre, a think tank which studies gender and sexuality in the '
             'military.  "You can\\\'t force people to go back in the closet, '
             "and you can\\'t force them to serve on the basis of a lie if "
             "they\\'ve already been honest about their identity. It\\'s "
             "unworkable for the troops and it\\'s unworkable for the "
             'military, and it will compromise military readiness."  Matthew '
             'Thorn, executive director of OutServe, warned that discharging '
             'thousands of active duty troops would would cause chaos and '
             'resentment.  "The most important thing for service members is '
             'that the person sitting on their right and their left has their '
             'back, particularly in a wartime situation," he said. "When you '
             "start stripping away those people, that\\'s what disrupts unit "
             'cohesion."  For those actively serving, who came out as '
             'transgender with an understanding from their commanders, and '
             'from President Obama, that they would no longer be discriminated '
             'against, the future is once again clouded by prejudice.  For '
             'Sergeant Ochoa, the only sensible response was to put on his '
             'dress blues, go to his graduation ceremony, and keep doing his '
             'job.  "The only thing I can do is carry on as best as I can, '
             'continue to be a professional and a drill sergeant to the best '
             'of my ability, and do that for as long as I have the '
             'opportunity," he said.  \\n',

             '2017, a study by the University of Pennsylvania School of '
             "Medicine found that men\\'s odds of survival were 23% higher "
             'than women when it came to resuscitation in public.  The study '
             'found receiving CPR in public in general is still rare, and '

             'immediate outrage on Twitter when they announced the all-female '
             'spacewalk would be cancelled over a medium-sized spacesuit.  The '

             'had been using, and so, for safety reasons, she was pulled from '
             'the walk.  There are two medium-sized suits on the International '
             'Space Station, but only one had been properly configured for a '
             'spacewalk, and getting the spare up to standard would have taken '
             "hours.  Ms Criado Perez says it\\'s still telling that the sizes "

             '3\\. Military equipment  In 2016, the US military began to '
             'recruit women for combat roles in previously male-only units in '
             'the Army, Marine Corps and Navy SEALs - but much of the armour '
             'was still designed for men.  The Army added eight smaller sizes '
             'to accommodate women that year, but other gear like shoes and '
             'helmets were not fully addressed.  Democratic Congresswoman Niki '
             "Tsongas at the time called out the military\\'s unresponsiveness "
             'to the needs of female service members, citing the "alarming" '
             'disadvantages for women, including being unable to properly fire '
             'a weapon, Military.com reported.  Several women told Buzzfeed '
             'News this year that during their service, they had been forced '
             'to adapt body armour to fit them, even if that meant removing '
             'protective side panels or putting pieces of foam under straps to '
             'reposition gear and ensure their organs were protected.  Last '
             'year, the Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford said they '
             'would work on speeding up the process of getting armour fitted '
             'for women, but the rollout of new gear remains incomplete.  '
             '"Women went through Iraq and Afghanistan - up to 2018 - in '
             'equipment designed for men," says Alex Elias, a scholar focusing '
             'on women in the military.  But even before these relatively new '
             'roles opened up, women in the military were forced to deal with '
             'dangerously improper attire. During World War Two, Ms Elias '
             'says, women were never expected to be in non-office roles, so '
             'the military failed to prepare uniforms for other jobs, like '
             'mechanics.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Andy '
             'Cross via Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## 4\\. Car crash '
             'dummies  Car crash dummies have a similar tale to CPR '
             'mannequins.  The US government did not adequately test the '
             'impact of a crash on a belt- restrained female dummy until 2012. '
             'Dummies for decades had been based on the average, 50th '
             'percentile male body.  According to a 2011 University of '
             'Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics study, that meant '
             'female drivers involved in crashes had a 47% greater chance of '
             'serious injury than their male counterparts, and a 71% higher '
             'chance of a moderate injury.  Ms Criado Perez notes that even '
             'now, this female dummy is often just a scaled down version of a '
             'male dummy, which does not provide accurate information about '
             "how a crash impacts a woman.  It\\'s a similar story in the "
             'European Union.  "In the EU, out of the five regulatory tests '
             'that there are, only one specifies that you must use that '
             '[female] dummy and it\\\'s only in the passenger seat."  She '
             "says it\\'s clear the industry is aware they must address the "
             'issue of women - but "they haven\\\'t done it in any sensible '
             'way that accounts for the fact that women are 50% of the '
             'population".  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## 5\\. Smartphones  From apps to '
             'the actual size, there are a number of design features that have '
             'made some women say smartphones have been designed with only men '
             "in mind.  Women\\'s hands are, on average, around an inch "
             "smaller than men\\'s - which can make the industry\\'s "
             'ever-increasing screen sizes problematic to use.  Texting '
             'one-handed on a 4.7-inch (12cm) or bigger iPhone can be '
             'difficult to impossible for many women (and small-handed men).  '
             '\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Ms Criado Perez also '
             'pointed out that the health app and Siri were also '
             'unintentionally biased against women.  In 2016, Apple fixed a '
             'glitch that had Siri sending abortion seekers to adoption '
             'centres instead - five years after the issue was raised.  "The '
             "comprehensive health app on the iPhone that didn\\'t have a "
             'period tracker; the way Siri could find a Viagra supplier but '
             "not an abortion provider - that\\'s what happens when you "
             'don\\\'t include women in the decision making process," Ms '
             'Criado Perez says.  "It\\\'s not a conspiracy. I don\\\'t think '
             'for a moment the designers of Apple wanted to screw women over - '
             'I think they didn\\\'t know."  ## 6\\. Sports attire  When US '
             'basketball superstar Stephen Curry designed a new line of shoes '
             'for kids last year, only boys sizes were offered.  A '
             'nine-year-old girl named Riley eventually wrote Mr Curry a '
             'letter asking why that was the case.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  "I know you support girl athletes because you '
             'have two daughters," she added. "I hope you can work with Under '
             "Armor to change this because girls want to rock the Curry 5\\'s "
             'too."  Mr Curry thanked her and explained that the smaller sizes '
             'had all been labelled as "boys" on the website.  \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  As of March 2019, boys still have '
             'more apparel options in the Under Armor Curry line, but most of '
             'the shoes are available for both genders.  ## 7\\. Science gear  '
             'Biologist Jessica Mounts, executive director of the Kansas '
             "Alliance for Wetlands and Streams, told the BBC\\'s Chris Bell "
             'that most of the equipment she has used was designed for men.  '
             '"The problems caused aren\\\'t simply an annoyance - they all go '
             'back to personal safety," she says. "Clothing that is too loose '
             'gets caught in moving equipment. Boots that are too big mean '
             'tripping and falling."  "The alternatives that are \\\'designed '
             "for women\\' are frequently more expensive, have smaller "
             'pockets, are still ill-fitting."  Read her full story here.  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n The Washington Post '
             'via Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## 8\\. Office space  These '
             "design flaws aren\\'t just about something worn or handled - "
             "even environments can be biased towards men\\'s preferences.  "
             'The formula for standard US office temperatures was developed in '
             'the 1960s, based on the metabolic rate of an average 40-year-old '
             'man weighing 154 pounds (70kg).  A 2015 study published in the '
             'journal Nature found that a female metabolic rate can be up to '
             '35% lower than the male rate used in those calculations - which '
             'amounts to, on average, a five degree temperature preference '
             'difference.  Last year, Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon '
             'brought the issue to headlines ahead of a primary debate with '
             'New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, when her team called his frigid '
             'temperature demands sexist.  Historian Shirley Wajda says: "For '
             "all the corporate talk about teamwork, it\\'s hard to feel part "
             'of a team when you are placed in an inhospitable physical '
             'environment."  She added that popular mesh office chairs '
             'exacerbate chilly conditions, while other seating fads like '
             'barstool-height chairs can be difficult for women in dresses or '
             'skirts to sit in comfortably.  Ms Wajda says when it comes to '
             '"gender-biased design and equipment, historians haven\\\'t paid '
             'as much attention", and trends towards standardisation for '
             'efficiency\\\'s sake lead to "a \\\'one size fits all\\\' sort '
             'of world".  For Ms Criado Perez, since publishing her book, '
             "it\\'s been gratifying to see an increased awareness of these "
             'issues - and, she adds, even the initial backlash about the Nasa '
             'spacesuits would never have happened a decade ago.  "But it '
             'makes me so angry to think of all these women, living their '
             "lives, thinking there\\'s something wrong with them - that "
             'they\\\'re too small or don\\\'t fit or whatever it is."  '
             '"It\\\'s just that we haven\\\'t built anything for women."  \\n',

             'the walk.  There are two medium-sized suits on the International '
             'Space Station, but only one had been properly configured for a '
             'spacewalk, and getting the spare up to standard would have taken '
             "hours.  Ms Criado Perez says it\\'s still telling that the sizes "
             'available were medium, large, and extra-large only.  \\n  \\n '

             'small sized suits in the 1990s due to budget cuts, NPR reported. '
             'That meant one-third of the women at the time were unable to fit '
             'into any spacesuits.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '

             '3\\. Military equipment  In 2016, the US military began to '
             'recruit women for combat roles in previously male-only units in '
             'the Army, Marine Corps and Navy SEALs - but much of the armour '
             'was still designed for men.  The Army added eight smaller sizes '
             'to accommodate women that year, but other gear like shoes and '
             'helmets were not fully addressed.  Democratic Congresswoman Niki '
             "Tsongas at the time called out the military\\'s unresponsiveness "
             'to the needs of female service members, citing the "alarming" '
             'disadvantages for women, including being unable to properly fire '
             'a weapon, Military.com reported.  Several women told Buzzfeed '
             'News this year that during their service, they had been forced '
             'to adapt body armour to fit them, even if that meant removing '
             'protective side panels or putting pieces of foam under straps to '
             'reposition gear and ensure their organs were protected.  Last '
             'year, the Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Joseph Dunford said they '
             'would work on speeding up the process of getting armour fitted '
             'for women, but the rollout of new gear remains incomplete.  '
             '"Women went through Iraq and Afghanistan - up to 2018 - in '
             'equipment designed for men," says Alex Elias, a scholar focusing '
             'on women in the military.  But even before these relatively new '
             'roles opened up, women in the military were forced to deal with '
             'dangerously improper attire. During World War Two, Ms Elias '
             'says, women were never expected to be in non-office roles, so '
             'the military failed to prepare uniforms for other jobs, like '
             'mechanics.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Andy '
             'Cross via Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## 4\\. Car crash '
             'dummies  Car crash dummies have a similar tale to CPR '
             'mannequins.  The US government did not adequately test the '
             'impact of a crash on a belt- restrained female dummy until 2012. '
             'Dummies for decades had been based on the average, 50th '
             'percentile male body.  According to a 2011 University of '
             'Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics study, that meant '
             'female drivers involved in crashes had a 47% greater chance of '
             'serious injury than their male counterparts, and a 71% higher '
             'chance of a moderate injury.  Ms Criado Perez notes that even '
             'now, this female dummy is often just a scaled down version of a '
             'male dummy, which does not provide accurate information about '
             "how a crash impacts a woman.  It\\'s a similar story in the "
             'European Union.  "In the EU, out of the five regulatory tests '
             'that there are, only one specifies that you must use that '
             '[female] dummy and it\\\'s only in the passenger seat."  She '
             "says it\\'s clear the industry is aware they must address the "
             'issue of women - but "they haven\\\'t done it in any sensible '
             'way that accounts for the fact that women are 50% of the '
             'population".  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n '
             'Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## 5\\. Smartphones  From apps to '
             'the actual size, there are a number of design features that have '
             'made some women say smartphones have been designed with only men '
             "in mind.  Women\\'s hands are, on average, around an inch "
             "smaller than men\\'s - which can make the industry\\'s "
             'ever-increasing screen sizes problematic to use.  Texting '
             'one-handed on a 4.7-inch (12cm) or bigger iPhone can be '
             'difficult to impossible for many women (and small-handed men).  '
             '\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  Ms Criado Perez also '
             'pointed out that the health app and Siri were also '
             'unintentionally biased against women.  In 2016, Apple fixed a '
             'glitch that had Siri sending abortion seekers to adoption '
             'centres instead - five years after the issue was raised.  "The '
             "comprehensive health app on the iPhone that didn\\'t have a "
             'period tracker; the way Siri could find a Viagra supplier but '
             "not an abortion provider - that\\'s what happens when you "
             'don\\\'t include women in the decision making process," Ms '
             'Criado Perez says.  "It\\\'s not a conspiracy. I don\\\'t think '
             'for a moment the designers of Apple wanted to screw women over - '
             'I think they didn\\\'t know."  ## 6\\. Sports attire  When US '
             'basketball superstar Stephen Curry designed a new line of shoes '
             'for kids last year, only boys sizes were offered.  A '
             'nine-year-old girl named Riley eventually wrote Mr Curry a '
             'letter asking why that was the case.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n \\n  "I know you support girl athletes because you '
             'have two daughters," she added. "I hope you can work with Under '
             "Armor to change this because girls want to rock the Curry 5\\'s "
             'too."  Mr Curry thanked her and explained that the smaller sizes '
             'had all been labelled as "boys" on the website.  \\n  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  As of March 2019, boys still have '
             'more apparel options in the Under Armor Curry line, but most of '
             'the shoes are available for both genders.  ## 7\\. Science gear  '
             'Biologist Jessica Mounts, executive director of the Kansas '
             "Alliance for Wetlands and Streams, told the BBC\\'s Chris Bell "
             'that most of the equipment she has used was designed for men.  '
             '"The problems caused aren\\\'t simply an annoyance - they all go '
             'back to personal safety," she says. "Clothing that is too loose '
             'gets caught in moving equipment. Boots that are too big mean '
             'tripping and falling."  "The alternatives that are \\\'designed '
             "for women\\' are frequently more expensive, have smaller "
             'pockets, are still ill-fitting."  Read her full story here.  \\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n The Washington Post '
             'via Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  ## 8\\. Office space  These '
             "design flaws aren\\'t just about something worn or handled - "
             "even environments can be biased towards men\\'s preferences.  "
             'The formula for standard US office temperatures was developed in '
             'the 1960s, based on the metabolic rate of an average 40-year-old '
             'man weighing 154 pounds (70kg).  A 2015 study published in the '
             'journal Nature found that a female metabolic rate can be up to '
             '35% lower than the male rate used in those calculations - which '
             'amounts to, on average, a five degree temperature preference '
             'difference.  Last year, Sex and the City actress Cynthia Nixon '
             'brought the issue to headlines ahead of a primary debate with '
             'New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, when her team called his frigid '
             'temperature demands sexist.  Historian Shirley Wajda says: "For '
             "all the corporate talk about teamwork, it\\'s hard to feel part "
             'of a team when you are placed in an inhospitable physical '
             'environment."  She added that popular mesh office chairs '
             'exacerbate chilly conditions, while other seating fads like '
             'barstool-height chairs can be difficult for women in dresses or '
             'skirts to sit in comfortably.  Ms Wajda says when it comes to '
             '"gender-biased design and equipment, historians haven\\\'t paid '
             'as much attention", and trends towards standardisation for '
             'efficiency\\\'s sake lead to "a \\\'one size fits all\\\' sort '
             'of world".  For Ms Criado Perez, since publishing her book, '
             "it\\'s been gratifying to see an increased awareness of these "
             'issues - and, she adds, even the initial backlash about the Nasa '
             'spacesuits would never have happened a decade ago.  "But it '
             'makes me so angry to think of all these women, living their '
             "lives, thinking there\\'s something wrong with them - that "
             'they\\\'re too small or don\\\'t fit or whatever it is."  '
             '"It\\\'s just that we haven\\\'t built anything for women."  \\n',

             'towards a waiting boat on a dark night in July 1979, he could '

             'believes the pirates were going to to attack again under the '
             'cover of darkness.  "Everyone went quiet on our boat and we '

             'huge storm turned the ocean into a mass of churning water.  Hanh '
             'recalls: "During the storm you could see the water was four '
             'metres above the boat, and then the next minute the boat would '
             'be high on top of a wave.  "Everyone was thinking it was the '
             'end. I thought of my wife and daughter, who was just eight '
             'months old.  "I said to God that\\\'s it, all yours. You can do '
             'whatever you want. As I passed out in the boat I heard the '
             'people praying."  When he came to, the storm had passed. Nobody '
             'had been lost overboard, and there were even dolphins swimming '
             'alongside them. It was a brief moment of celebration.  "We were '
             'getting close to Indonesia," said Hanh. "Two very big ships came '
             'towards us and started shooting. You could see the bullets '
             'hitting the water and hear them flying over our heads."  ## '
             'Washed ashore  Rejected once again, this time Hanh and his '
             'fellow boat people were in luck as the current took them towards '
             'a nearby deserted island.  "We were very, very happy to reach '
             'land," said Hanh. "The boat was destroyed so we could not be '
             'forced to get back into it."  When the owners of the island '
             'arrived ten days later to harvest coconuts, contact was made '
             "with the mainland and Hanh\\'s journey to a new life in the UK "
             'began.  As he was travelling west, he was given the glad news '
             'that the rest of his family had made it to Singapore after also '
             'escaping from Vietnam.  ## Finding sanctuary in Newport  \\n \\n '

             'life in Newport\\n \\n \\n \\n  In April 1980 Hanh was living '
             'along with the rest of his family in a refugee centre in '
             'Hastings, Kent. Because Vietnamese families like to stay '
             'together, Hanh, his nine siblings and his parents were offered a '
             'large house in Newport, south Wales.  "The first time I saw '
             'Newport I felt like I was in the countryside," said Hanh. "It '
             'was so green and lovely and peaceful.  "There wasn\\\'t as much '
             'development back then, so it felt like a small town. People were '
             'so nice and helpful. Even though there was a language barrier, '
             'you got help as soon as you left the house."  His siblings '
             'gradually left over the years but Hanh stayed the longest, '

             'UK\\n \\n \\n \\n  Nature then turned against the refugees as a '
             'huge storm turned the ocean into a mass of churning water.  Hanh '
             'recalls: "During the storm you could see the water was four '
             'metres above the boat, and then the next minute the boat would '
             'be high on top of a wave.  "Everyone was thinking it was the '
             'end. I thought of my wife and daughter, who was just eight '
             'months old.  "I said to God that\\\'s it, all yours. You can do '
             'whatever you want. As I passed out in the boat I heard the '
             'people praying."  When he came to, the storm had passed. Nobody '
             'had been lost overboard, and there were even dolphins swimming '
             'alongside them. It was a brief moment of celebration.  "We were '
             'getting close to Indonesia," said Hanh. "Two very big ships came '
             'towards us and started shooting. You could see the bullets '
             'hitting the water and hear them flying over our heads."  ## '
             'Washed ashore  Rejected once again, this time Hanh and his '
             'fellow boat people were in luck as the current took them towards '
             'a nearby deserted island.  "We were very, very happy to reach '
             'land," said Hanh. "The boat was destroyed so we could not be '
             'forced to get back into it."  When the owners of the island '
             'arrived ten days later to harvest coconuts, contact was made '
             "with the mainland and Hanh\\'s journey to a new life in the UK "
             'began.  As he was travelling west, he was given the glad news '
             'that the rest of his family had made it to Singapore after also '
             'escaping from Vietnam.  ## Finding sanctuary in Newport  \\n \\n '

             '\\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Hanh and his family started a new '
             'life in Newport\\n \\n \\n \\n  In April 1980 Hanh was living '
             'along with the rest of his family in a refugee centre in '
             'Hastings, Kent. Because Vietnamese families like to stay '
             'together, Hanh, his nine siblings and his parents were offered a '
             'large house in Newport, south Wales.  "The first time I saw '
             'Newport I felt like I was in the countryside," said Hanh. "It '
             'was so green and lovely and peaceful.  "There wasn\\\'t as much '
             'development back then, so it felt like a small town. People were '
             'so nice and helpful. Even though there was a language barrier, '
             'you got help as soon as you left the house."  His siblings '
             'gradually left over the years but Hanh stayed the longest, '
             'raising a family in Newport.  He now lives in London, part of a '
             'Vietnamese community where he continues to keep alive the '
             'stories of those who took their chances on the ocean 40 years '
             'ago.   **The**Freedom 360 exhibition **with the Welsh National '

             'The issue of the Irish border after Brexit will "not be a '
             'problem at all," Donald Trump has claimed on his first visit to '
             'Ireland as US President.  He arrived at Shannon Airport at about '
             '16:45 local time and held a meeting with Taoiseach (Irish PM) '
             'Leo Varadkar.  He told Mr Varadkar that Americans "love the '
             'Irish" and said he believed things would work out well with '
             '"with your wall, your border" after Brexit.  Mr Trump then '
             'travelled to Doonbeg to stay at his golf resort.  He bought the '
             'Doonbeg hotel and golf course in County Clare in 2014.  \\n \\n '

             'in Ireland at about 16:45 local time\\n \\n \\n \\n  Mr Varadkar '
             'welcomed Mr Trump to Ireland and said it was the sixth time that '
             'a serving American president has visited the state.  Mr Trump '
             'described Mr Varadkar as his friend and said the relationship '
             'between Ireland and the US was "as good as it\\\'s ever been, '
             'maybe better".  The president added that there were "millions" '
             'of Irish people in the US and said: "I think I know most of them '
             'because they\\\'re my friends.  "We love the Irish, so it\\\'s '

             'Airport\\n \\n \\n \\n  Mr Trump, who just completed a three-day '
             'state visit to the UK, said he would discuss Brexit, the '
             'military and trade during his meeting with Mr Varadkar.  '
             '"Probably you\\\'ll ask me about Brexit because I just left some '
             'very good people who are very much involved with Brexit as you '
             'know, and I think it will all work out very well," Mr Trump '
             'said.  "And also for you, with your wall, your border. We have a '
             'border situation in the United States and you have one over '
             'here, but I hear it\\\'s going to work out very well."  The '
             'taoiseach pointed out the Irish government wanted to avoid "a '
             'border or wall" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern '
             'Ireland.  Mr Trump replied: "I think you do, I think you do. The '
             'way it works now is good, you want to try and keep it that '
             'way."  \\n  The president added that Ireland was in "great '
             'shape" and that once a new UK prime minister was installed in '
             'Downing Street, he hoped a Brexit deal or resolution could be '
             'negotiated with the EU.  He also said he hoped the US and Irish '
             'government would agree on access to E3 working visas for Irish '
             'citizens to the US.  The two leaders then went to meet in '
             'private.  In a solo press conference after the meeting, Mr '
             "Varadkar was asked about Mr Trump\\'s description of the Irish "
             'border as a "wall" and whether or not the president understood '
             'how much the Irish government wanted to avoid a hard border '
             'after Brexit.  "He\\\'s the president of America and there are '
             "nearly 200 countries in the world, so I don\\'t think it\\'s "
             'possible for him to have an in-depth understanding of issues in '
             'every single country, which is why this engagement is '

             '\\n \\n  The taoiseach also said: "He is in favour of Brexit as '

             'is the border between north and south and he shares our '
             'objective to keep the border open as it is now, respecting the '
             'Good Friday Agreement."  Mr Varadkar also said the pair '

             'tax and agreed on the need for governments to work together to '

             'a two-way relationship".  "Ireland is in the top 10 when it '

             'nearly 100,000 Americans working for Irish-owned firms in the '

             'courage and sacrifice" of those who died in the D-Day landings.  '
             'She was joined by 16 world leaders, including US President '
             'Donald Trump, in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary '
             "of history\\'s largest combined land, air and naval operation.  "
             'Mr Trump, who was on the last day of his UK state visit, said '
             'D-Day "may have been the greatest battle ever".  Veterans of the '
             'landings in Normandy to liberate western Europe also attended.  '
             'The commemorations included:  \\n    * A flypast by the Red '
             'Arrows RAF aerobatic team and historic aircraft  \\n    * '

             'leaders from the diaries and letters of people who fought and '
             'died in the war \\n    * An hour-long production telling the '
             'story of the invasion \\n    * A joint statement by 16 countries '
             'pledging to avoid a repeat of the "unimaginable horrors" of the '
             'conflict \\n  The Queen said the veterans of D-Day demonstrated '
             '"more than courage and endurance", showing "unconquerable '
             'resolve".  The quotes came from a broadcast by her father, King '
             'George VI, made at the time of the massive operation that '
             'signalled the end of Nazi power in Western Europe.  "The fate of '
             'the world depended on their success," she said. "Many of them '
             'would never return, and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of '
             'those who lost their lives will never be forgotten."  She '
             'thanked them "with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the '
             'entire country, indeed the whole free world".  \\n  \\n  '

             'US on charges of human trafficking, child rape and other '
             'felonies.  Naasón Joaquín García, who heads La Luz del Mundo '
             '(The Light of the World) church, was detained at Los Angeles '
             'airport, California prosecutors said.  Mr García, known as "the '
             'Apostle" among his followers, and his three female co-defendants '
             'are facing 26 charges.  La Luz del Mundo said it was confident '
             'Mr García would be proven innocent.  The organisation, which has '
             'headquarters in Mexico, says it has baptised more than five '

             'on Tuesday, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Mr '
             'García, a Mexican national, and the three women allegedly '
             'committed 26 felonies in southern California between 2015 and '
             '2018.  These included human trafficking, production of child sex '

             'President Donald Trump has said "not nearly enough" progress is '
             'being made in negotiations with Mexico to avert his threatened '
             "tariffs.  Trump administration officials hosted Mexico\\'s "
             'foreign minister at the White House on Wednesday, and they will '
             'meet again on Thursday.  Mr Trump said import duties of 5% will '
             'take effect next Monday unless Mexico stems the migrant flow '
             'into the US.  Those numbers reached their highest level in more '
             'than a decade last month.  ## What happened in the '
             'negotiations?  US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of '
             'State Mike Pompeo held talks with Mexican Foreign Minister '
             'Marcelo Ebrard at the White House on Wednesday, but the meeting '
             'ended without agreement.  Mr Ebrard told a news conference '
             'afterwards that tariffs were not even discussed.  "The dialogue '
             'was focused on migration flows and what Mexico is doing or is '
             'proposing to the United States, our concern about the Central '
             'American situation," he said.  The US president, who is in '
             'Europe for World War Two commemorations, warned on Twitter that '
             'the tariffs would go ahead next Monday without a breakthrough.  '
             '\\n  \\n  Republican senators have been speaking out against the '
             'planned Mexico tariffs, which Mr Trump announced last week on '
             'Twitter, catching his party and the financial markets unawares.  '
             'Under his proposal, duties would rise by 5% every month on goods '
             'including cars, beer, tequila, fruit and vegetables, reaching '
             '25% by October.  The Republican president wants Mexico to stop '
             'the hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American migrants '
             'who have been seeking entry to the US this year.  \\n  \\n  '

             'the fence near El Paso, Texas, in the largest single border '
             'breach ever recorded\\n  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro '
             'had raised hopes earlier on Wednesday of a possible '
             'rapprochement.  He told CNN "we believe that these tariffs may '
             'not have to go into effect, precisely because we have the '
             'Mexicans\\\' attention".  Mr Navarro said Mr Trump wants Mexico '
             'to commit to take all asylum seekers and to divert more '
             'resources to its own southern border with Guatemala.  America is '
             'already embattled in a trade war with China that has seen '
             "tit-for- tat duties imposed on imports.  ## What\\'s the "

             'President Donald Trump has said "not nearly enough" progress is '
             'being made in negotiations with Mexico to avert his threatened '
             "tariffs.  Trump administration officials hosted Mexico\\'s "
             'foreign minister at the White House on Wednesday, and they will '
             'meet again on Thursday.  Mr Trump said import duties of 5% will '
             'take effect next Monday unless Mexico stems the migrant flow '
             'into the US.  Those numbers reached their highest level in more '
             'than a decade last month.  ## What happened in the '
             'negotiations?  US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of '
             'State Mike Pompeo held talks with Mexican Foreign Minister '
             'Marcelo Ebrard at the White House on Wednesday, but the meeting '
             'ended without agreement.  Mr Ebrard told a news conference '
             'afterwards that tariffs were not even discussed.  "The dialogue '
             'was focused on migration flows and what Mexico is doing or is '
             'proposing to the United States, our concern about the Central '
             'American situation," he said.  The US president, who is in '
             'Europe for World War Two commemorations, warned on Twitter that '
             'the tariffs would go ahead next Monday without a breakthrough.  '
             '\\n  \\n  Republican senators have been speaking out against the '
             'planned Mexico tariffs, which Mr Trump announced last week on '
             'Twitter, catching his party and the financial markets unawares.  '
             'Under his proposal, duties would rise by 5% every month on goods '
             'including cars, beer, tequila, fruit and vegetables, reaching '
             '25% by October.  The Republican president wants Mexico to stop '
             'the hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American migrants '
             'who have been seeking entry to the US this year.  \\n  \\n  '

             'not have to go into effect, precisely because we have the '
             'Mexicans\\\' attention".  Mr Navarro said Mr Trump wants Mexico '
             'to commit to take all asylum seekers and to divert more '
             'resources to its own southern border with Guatemala.  America is '

             'Canadian man unlocked a safe that had sat unopened in a small '
             'museum for decades, cracking the code on his first try with a '
             'lucky guess.  Stephen Mills was visiting the Vermilion Heritage '
             'Museum with his family when he had a go at opening the iron box '
             '"for a laugh".  The museum in the province of Alberta had '
             'previously tried numerous times to unlock the old safe - to no '
             'avail.  The safe had not been opened since the late 1970s.  The '
             'museum, housed in an old brick school building, hosts a '
             'collection on the history of Vermilion, a town of just over '
             '4,000 people.  Mr Mills, from Fort McMurray, Alberta, was '
             'visiting Vermilion with his extended family during a long '
             'weekend in May.  "When we go camping every summer, we\\\'ve come '
             'to learn that every small town, no matter where you go, has '
             'something to offer," he told the BBC.  So the family brought the '
             'children to see the museum and was given a tour by volunteer Tom '
             'Kibblewhite.  One of the exhibits was a safe that had originally '
             "been in the town\\'s Brunswick Hotel, which had opened in 1906.  "
             'The safe itself is believed to have been bought in 1907.  It was '
             'donated to the museum in the early 1990s after the hotel changed '
             'ownership and was renovated.  Mr Mills said when they were shown '
             'the safe, the whole family "was intrigued".  ## How did he do '
             'it?  The museum had previously enlisted the help of experts to '
             'crack the code, tried default combinations, and had contacted '

             'Canadian man unlocked a safe that had sat unopened in a small '
             'museum for decades, cracking the code on his first try with a '
             'lucky guess.  Stephen Mills was visiting the Vermilion Heritage '
             'Museum with his family when he had a go at opening the iron box '
             '"for a laugh".  The museum in the province of Alberta had '
             'previously tried numerous times to unlock the old safe - to no '
             'avail.  The safe had not been opened since the late 1970s.  The '
             'museum, housed in an old brick school building, hosts a '
             'collection on the history of Vermilion, a town of just over '
             '4,000 people.  Mr Mills, from Fort McMurray, Alberta, was '
             'visiting Vermilion with his extended family during a long '
             'weekend in May.  "When we go camping every summer, we\\\'ve come '
             'to learn that every small town, no matter where you go, has '
             'something to offer," he told the BBC.  So the family brought the '
             'children to see the museum and was given a tour by volunteer Tom '
             'Kibblewhite.  One of the exhibits was a safe that had originally '
             "been in the town\\'s Brunswick Hotel, which had opened in 1906.  "
             'The safe itself is believed to have been bought in 1907.  It was '
             'donated to the museum in the early 1990s after the hotel changed '
             'ownership and was renovated.  Mr Mills said when they were shown '
             'the safe, the whole family "was intrigued".  ## How did he do '
             'it?  The museum had previously enlisted the help of experts to '
             'crack the code, tried default combinations, and had contacted '
             'former hotel employees to see if they could help.  Like the '
             'Mills family, other museum visitors played around with trying to '
             'open it, with no success.  "I said to [Mr Kibblewhite]: '

             "They don\\'t want to alienate customers by taking sides on a "
             'highly divisive issue. And business thinks in terms of keeping '

             "power doesn\\'t count for much when most who have worked with "

             "Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  So the business lobbies\\' polite respect "
             'for democracy has reached its limits, when the process is mired '
             'in crisis; a prime minister whose cabinet is openly split, and '
             'who cannot get her key policy through the House of Commons, who '
             'is protected by the combination of a further eight-month ban on '
             "internal party challenges, her party\\'s fear of precipitating a "
             'general election and the lack of appetite for a leadership '
             'contest for now.  Meanwhile, she remains resolutely stuck on '
             'getting her deal approved.  To this, add a national election for '
             'MEPs, for which no-one was prepared, for which Conservative and '
             'Labour parties have neither clear nor unifying messages, '
             'motivated activists, campaign funds or even candidates '
             "selected.  It\\'s a political environment in which populist "
             'voices can run riot.  Hence, the messaging from business lobbies '
             'on the morning after the summit night before is a loud reminder '
             'that nothing has been resolved.  Exactly the same problems '
             'persist, and unless something is done to resolve the crisis, '
             "we\\'ll reach the new Halloween departure date, and be back on "
             "the same scary \\'no deal\\' cliff-edge.  Emboldened by the "
             'damage already being done to businesses - investment stalled, '
             'contracts delayed, some jobs lost (though not many, it seems) - '
             'the business lobby groups are talking about revoking Article 50 '
             'or about another referendum.  ## Ironic lady  So, to venture '
             "into constitutional politics, let\\'s look at those options. "
             'Those who oppose remaining in the European Union, following the '
             '2016 referendum result, talk darkly of forces being unleashed '
             "that the ruling class won\\'t like.  There is implicit, and "
             'apparently genuine fear of the mob. Either it is seen storming '
             'down Whitehall to the House of Commons, wielding pitchforks or '
             'worse, or it will show its anger at the ballot box, turning to '
             'populists and demagogues who wield simplistic or extreme '
             "solutions.  The message: \\'if you thought that red bus with the "
             "NHS slogan was bad, you ain\\'t seen nothin\\' yet.\\'  \\n \\n "
             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n  The other side of this gets less attention - what if '
             "Remainers got their way? (Let\\'s assume that those who want "
             "another referendum also want it to result in a \\'Remain\\' "
             "majority - though don\\'t forget that many who would prefer to "
             'remain are unpersuaded of the referendum option, as they fear it '
             "could repeat \\'Leave\\', or be as close and divisive as 2016.)  "
             'I was at Westminster last month on the same day of the vast '
             'march calling for another referendum. It struck me that marchers '
             'were from a narrow range of Remain stereotypes - notably ageing '
             "liberals and students.  I wasn\\'t seeing much evidence of "
             'people marching to complain that they had been misled into '
             'voting Leave and wanted a chance to vote the opposite way. '
             "That\\'s what the polls also tell us.  What I also noted was "
             'that the message was a narrow one. Understandably, it focussed '
             'on the spectacular burach that Theresa May and her government '
             'have made of the Brexit process.  If judging a march by its '
             'placards, this is focussed on the personalities of Tory '
             'politicians, sometimes abusively, with a large dose of British '
             "irony. In answer to Theresa May\\'s version of the Iron Lady, "
             'this was the ironic lady.  The easy, unifying message for '
             'Remainers is that Leavers got us into this mess, and seem '
             'incapable of finding a way out, so - as the main slogan goes - '
             'let the people decide.  ## Persuadables  But what if they are '
             'successful? What if there is another referendum? And what if '
             'Britain does exit the European Union - from which a campaign '
             "could quickly start to get back in?  I wasn\\'t seeing banners "
             'or hearing slogans with which to win the argument decisively, or '
             'at all.  I could see many European flags, of course. The TV '
             "broadcasts from Westminster\\'s College Green are festooned with "
             'the blue and stars. During 45 years of membership, these were '
             'rarely waved with any pride by British people.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  '
             '\\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  Now '
             'a rallying standard, the EU flag seems more likely to be a '
             'turn-off or a provocation than an appeal to those who may be '
             'wavering in the centre ground on this debate.  Somehow, the '
             'pro-Europe side of the debate needs to make EU membership the '
             'patriotic thing to do for Union Flag wavers, and Saltires in '
             'Scotland, with a message aimed at the centre ground of '
             'persuadables - the message that the David Cameron campaign '
             'failed to articulate in 2016.  That would have to counter '
             "Brexiteers\\' simple arguments that Britain lacks control of its "
             'destiny while part of the European Union.  ## Counter factual  '
             'It would have to explain why it sees European membership as '
             "being in Britain\\'s interests, without mind-numbing references "
             'to co-decision between Parliament and Council, using the '
             'Qualified Majority Voting system.  "You\\\'re better off in '
             'Europe" might work, but it doesn\\\'t feel that way to many '
             'voters who are not feeling better off. They tend not to trust an '
             "economist bearing a counter-factual. They\\'re feeling a squeeze "
             "on household budgets over the past decade and they\\'re feeling "
             'peeved off.  Perhaps it needs broken down, in tribute to that '
             'Life of Brian discussion of "what the Romans have ever done for '
             'us"; olive oil, a plentiful choice of cheese, no more roaming '

             'class list!)  How about the scale of market that brings Japanese '
             "car manufacturers to Britain\\'s shores? Being part of Europe "

             'bit wonkish already, you see?) and the right to stay, work and '
             'invest there if you fancy opening your own pizzeria.  Given '
             'another referendum, Remainers could look to a greater public '
             'understanding of the benefits brought to Britain by immigration. '
             'People are much clearer now how much business, including '
             'agriculture, and the NHS, rely on staffing from across the EU.  '
             "But that doesn\\'t mean hostility to immigration, or simply "
             'concern about it, has gone away. It still has to be addressed. '
             'It can still be ruthlessly exploited.  And then, how about the '
             'slogan "peace in our time"? OK, so it didn\\\'t work well for '
             'Neville Chamberlain. But it is perhaps the greatest historical '

             "generations, across Europe, who take the continent\\'s peace for "

             "Europe, there\\'s another side to this, to be found on the other "
             'side of the EU table. For now, the leaders of the EU 27 are '

             'be kicking Britain out.  But patience has, understandably, been '

             'Brexit is that the most significant element was the disagreement '
             'between France and Germany. Brexit strains are telling on the '
             'Paris-Berlin motor that has long powered the EU project.  If '
             'Britain were to find a way to reverse the Brexit decision - '
             'through revocation or a referendum - the UK can expect to retain '

             'remain outside the euro currency and of the Schengen-free travel '
             'area.  ## Equal status  But a renewed membership of the EU club '
             'would come with expectations that Britain properly and '
             'permanently commits - if not to the full-blooded project of "an '
             'ever closer union", at least to playing a constructive role in '
             "future developments.  Don\\'t hold your breath for this, but its "
             'political leaders could be expected by others to better explain '
             'and support decisions of the Council of Ministers and the '
             'European Court of Justice.  For Britain to be a settled member, '
             'it would need a political discourse, to be found in many '
             'European countries and also in Scotland, which combines two or '
             'more political identities, and which accepts that membership of '
             'the club is compatible with sovereignty, that national interest '
             'lies in being within the club, and its compromises are necessary '
             'to pursue combined national and collective interests.  '
             'Symbolically, a Britain remaining in Europe would have to fly '
             'the flags with equal status.  Outside Holyrood since the '
             'Parliament building was opened, the three flags of Scotland, the '
             'UK and Europe have flown at the same height.  Even among those '
             'who support Britain having a place in Europe, we seem a long way '
             'from accepting multiple identities in the official flags which '
             'fly above the Houses of Parliament. But for the settled will of '
             'the British people to be within Europe, that is a symbolic '

             'who cannot get her key policy through the House of Commons, who '
             'is protected by the combination of a further eight-month ban on '

             'Labour parties have neither clear nor unifying messages, '

             'the business lobby groups are talking about revoking Article 50 '

             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n  The other side of this gets less attention - what if '
             "Remainers got their way? (Let\\'s assume that those who want "
             "another referendum also want it to result in a \\'Remain\\' "
             "majority - though don\\'t forget that many who would prefer to "
             'remain are unpersuaded of the referendum option, as they fear it '
             "could repeat \\'Leave\\', or be as close and divisive as 2016.)  "
             'I was at Westminster last month on the same day of the vast '
             'march calling for another referendum. It struck me that marchers '
             'were from a narrow range of Remain stereotypes - notably ageing '
             "liberals and students.  I wasn\\'t seeing much evidence of "
             'people marching to complain that they had been misled into '
             'voting Leave and wanted a chance to vote the opposite way. '
             "That\\'s what the polls also tell us.  What I also noted was "
             'that the message was a narrow one. Understandably, it focussed '
             'on the spectacular burach that Theresa May and her government '
             'have made of the Brexit process.  If judging a march by its '
             'placards, this is focussed on the personalities of Tory '
             'politicians, sometimes abusively, with a large dose of British '
             "irony. In answer to Theresa May\\'s version of the Iron Lady, "
             'this was the ironic lady.  The easy, unifying message for '
             'Remainers is that Leavers got us into this mess, and seem '
             'incapable of finding a way out, so - as the main slogan goes - '
             'let the people decide.  ## Persuadables  But what if they are '
             'successful? What if there is another referendum? And what if '

             "broadcasts from Westminster\\'s College Green are festooned with "
             'the blue and stars. During 45 years of membership, these were '

             'turn-off or a provocation than an appeal to those who may be '
             'wavering in the centre ground on this debate.  Somehow, the '
             'pro-Europe side of the debate needs to make EU membership the '

             'Scotland, with a message aimed at the centre ground of '

             "Brexiteers\\' simple arguments that Britain lacks control of its "

             "those who want a lot more such change, there\\'s a need to learn "
             'those lessons, and to be seen to be a long way from what has '
             'happened with the departure from the European Union.  That is '
             "Andrew Wilson\\'s take. Since its report was published, he "

             'with me, for Good Morning Scotland, broadcast on Sunday. He was '
             'speaking up ahead of a crunch vote at the SNP conference.  '
             'Wilson, a former SNP MSP, is not saying if there was a deficit '
             'of honesty and truth-telling in the white paper in 2014. The '
             'argument is already tense enough, he is eager to avoid negative '
             'messages about others, and the faithful are still hankering '
             'after the feelgood factor of 2014.  That was a document for '

             'for which the rationale changes radically in less than five '
             "years. It\\'s for keeps.  But then, if the arguments didn\\'t "
             'get independence past 50% back then, it may be unwise to keep '
             'plugging them. Better, says Wilson, to find the arguments that '
             'could persuade enough people to make the journey from the status '
             "quo to \\'yes\\'.  ## Trade-offs  That voter journey is hugely "
             'helped by the status quo having disappeared. Brexit has undercut '
             'the argument that being in Britain provides political or '
             'economic stability or, of course, a secure place within Europe.  '
             'But one of the lessons of Brexit is that bold assertions of what '
             'might be achieved, eventually, either through "taking back '
             'control" or saying "yes" with lots of enthusiasm, are worth '
             'little when set against the complexity of transition.  And for '
             'that reason, Andrew Wilson is clear that it is transition that '
             'needs much more attention from the SNP. He reckons increasing '
             'numbers will accept the case for Scotland to make a success of '
             "independence in the long term. It\\'s the short term where they "

             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n  That requires choices, '

             'Commission sought to illustrate the choices ahead by '
             'illustrating a scenario for the short to medium term, which '
             'would take Scotland through deficit reduction, setting up the '
             'institutions of a central bank and making a shift to a Scottish '
             "currency that doesn\\'t harm jobs and the wider economy.  This "
             'is the path of reassurance to the 10 to 15% of persuadable '
             'voters, according to Wilson.  ## Saltire blueprint  The deficit '
             'reduction programme is the item in the weighty Commission report '
             "that got most attention from the SNP\\'s opponents. Labour "
             'reckons it looks like another decade of austerity, only worse '
             'than the last one.  Wilson says that can be avoided if the '
             'Scottish economy can be grown faster. The problem is that the '
             'way to grow it faster is through improved productivity. That is '
             'a long-term project. Short term, the answer is seen as turning '
             'on the immigration taps, and measures to draw more people into '
             "the workforce.  But in Andrew Wilson\\'s interview, what he made "
             'clear is that his report is not the Saltire-shaped blueprint for '
             'the future of the Scottish economy, however much it might have '
             'been seen that way.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Reuters\\n \\n \\n \\n  The controversial short '
             'term measures are about transition and the platform on which to '
             'build stability, he says. From there, decisions can then be made '
             'about the kind of Scotland voters want - the level and balance '
             'of taxation, for instance, the extent of spending and the scale '
             "of welfare support, and how big the state should be.  As we\\'re "
             'already learning with the increased income tax powers at '
             'Holyrood, these decisions are not made in a vacuum. They invite '
             '"behavioural effects", where taxpayers re-arrange their '
             'financial affairs to minimise tax bills, so they can be '
             'profoundly affected by taxation decisions made in other '
             'countries.  These are the next raft of questions, over which '
             'parties can compete for control of a newly-independent Scottish '

             'commissions are envisaged: on productivity, infrastructure, '
             'equal pay, and more committees to look into innovation, '
             'university commercialisation, inward investment, and so on. On '
             "some of these fronts, such as university spin-outs, there\\'s "
             'already activity.  A final thought about lessons from Brexit. To '
             'listen to the debate at Westminster, those who once thought a '
             'referendum would resolve the European question have learned '
             'quite a lot - not only that it can do the precise opposite if '
             'the result is close, but that it unleashes a mob mentality which '
             'seems to have politicians from Labour and Conservative genuinely '
             "scared.  With the exception of the so-called People\\'s Vote on "
             'Europe, it is close to impossible to imagine any major and '
             'deeply divisive issue at Westminster being resolved through a '
             'future referendum.  So where does that leave the referendum as '
             "the SNP\\'s chosen route to independence? Some had their doubts "
             'when it became official party policy less than 20 years ago. '
             'Now, they have to contend with the SNP currently campaigning for '
             "a second, confirmatory vote on Brexit.  It\\'s not a helpful "
             'precedent for those who want to see such a transition kept '

             'that seeks to fight online sex trafficking.  The Electronic '
             'Frontier Foundation (EFF) says the "poorly written" law can '
             'hinder attempts to help victims and prosecute traffickers.  The '
             'Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (Fosta) also trespasses on free '
             'speech laws, claims the lawsuit.  The EFF wants the law declared '
             'unconstitutional to stop it being enforced.  ## Repeat warning  '
             'In a blog announcing its legal action, the EFF said the law '
             'needed to be halted because, in its current form, it was harming '
             'many people working on behalf of sex workers and victims.  In '
             'particular, said the EFF, the vague language in Fosta puts those '
             'who call for decriminalisation of sex work, or who try to '
             'establish greater recognition for prostitutes and others in the '
             'trade, at the risk of prosecution.  In addition, it said, the '
             'law undermines established protections enjoyed by websites that '
             'host content posted by their users.  Fosta "vastly magnifies" '
             'the risk these net firms bear if they choose to run ads on '
             'forums dedicated to these sexual professions, it said.  Already '
             'net firms including Craigslist, Reddit and others have shut down '
             'forums and chat rooms dedicated to the buying and selling of sex '
             'for fear of prosecution.  The law has also limited the work of '
             'organisations trying to help people who offer sexual services, '
             'said the EFF. One such was VerifyHim, which logged descriptions '
             "of abusive clients to help workers avoid them.  The EFF\\'s "
             'legal challenge is also being aided by the Internet Archive, '
             'Human Rights Watch and Woodhull Freedom Foundation. In addition, '
             'two individuals are backing it - one a spokesperson for sex '
             'workers and another a masseur who now finds it hard to advertise '
             'his non-sexual service.  The US Congress was repeatedly warned '
             'that Fosta would not achieve its aims and was likely to foster '
             'widespread censorship, said the EFF.  \\n',

             'needed to be halted because, in its current form, it was harming '
             'many people working on behalf of sex workers and victims.  In '
             'particular, said the EFF, the vague language in Fosta puts those '
             'who call for decriminalisation of sex work, or who try to '
             'establish greater recognition for prostitutes and others in the '
             'trade, at the risk of prosecution.  In addition, it said, the '
             'law undermines established protections enjoyed by websites that '
             'host content posted by their users.  Fosta "vastly magnifies" '
             'the risk these net firms bear if they choose to run ads on '
             'forums dedicated to these sexual professions, it said.  Already '
             'net firms including Craigslist, Reddit and others have shut down '
             'forums and chat rooms dedicated to the buying and selling of sex '
             'for fear of prosecution.  The law has also limited the work of '
             'organisations trying to help people who offer sexual services, '
             'said the EFF. One such was VerifyHim, which logged descriptions '
             "of abusive clients to help workers avoid them.  The EFF\\'s "
             'legal challenge is also being aided by the Internet Archive, '
             'Human Rights Watch and Woodhull Freedom Foundation. In addition, '
             'two individuals are backing it - one a spokesperson for sex '
             'workers and another a masseur who now finds it hard to advertise '
             'his non-sexual service.  The US Congress was repeatedly warned '
             'that Fosta would not achieve its aims and was likely to foster '
             'widespread censorship, said the EFF.  \\n',

             'researchers asking the prime minister to "robustly challenge" '
             'President Trump on the topic.  In a letter to Mrs May, 250 '
             'academics say the president\\\'s "reckless approach is a threat '
             'to the whole world".  In 2018, the president accused climate '
             'experts of having a "political agenda".  A spokesperson for the '

             'Hancox\\n \\n \\n \\n  **Ted Cordery was a 20-year-old torpedo '
             'man for the navy when he stood on the upper deck of HMS Belfast '
             'and looked helplessly on as dozens of men drowned around him.**  '
             "D-Day, on June 6 1944, was the world\\'s largest seaborne "
             'assault and the beginning of the Allied invasion of '
             'Nazi-occupied Europe.  But many of the first troops to arrive at '
             'Normandy, in northern France, were accidentally dropped off by '
             'their landing boats in too-deep water, where they sank under the '
             'weight of their guns and equipment.  Others suffered from '
             'seasickness caused by the flat bottoms on the smaller boats '
             '"bouncing" across the waves.  Speaking to the BBC from his home '
             'in Oxford, Ted, now 95, vividly remembers the events of that day '
             '75 years ago and says the horrific things he witnessed will stay '
             'with him forever.  He says: "I felt so sorry for the men. They '
             'were coming from a fair way out to get to the beach, and they '
             'were all in their uniforms and carrying guns and their own food, '
             'so they all had these cans weighing them down.  "I looked at '
             'them as we were passing them and I thought to myself, if '
             "you\\'re seasick and you\\'re then expected to get off the boat "
             'and start fighting… come on.  "The water was a bit choppy, which '
             "made no difference to us, but if you\\'re in a flat bottom boat "
             'and its a bit choppy you can really feel it.  "What those men '
             "went through. It\\'s asking a lot isn\\'t it? I think so. Those "
             'men are bloody marvellous.  "So many of them didn\\\'t make it '
             'because they were dropped too far from the land. They went '
             'straight in the deep water and drowned."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             "mother\\'s lap\\n \\n \\n \\n  D-Day began with a damp, grey "
             'dawn over the English Channel. More than 6,330 boats carrying '
             'thousands of men readied themselves to launch the invasion of '
             'Nazi-occupied Europe.  The night before, Ted and his fellow crew '
             'were told they were joining a large operation, but they had no '
             'idea of the scale until they saw the other ships.  But they were '
             'not nervous. Ted says: "Well, you see, once you\\\'ve gone to '
             "sea you\\'ve always got to be ready for action, U-boats, "
             'anything.  "It\\\'s like everything, you go into something '
             "strange and of course you\\'re apprehensive, even if you\\'re "
             'not frightened, because you just get on with it - and please God '
             'you\\\'ll be alright."  HMS Belfast was the flagship of '
             'Bombardment Force E, supporting troops landing at Gold and Juno '
             'beaches by attacking German defences.  The ship came under '
             'occasional fire from German artillery and dive-bombers but '
             'managed to battle on unscathed as it continued to hit German '
             'positions.  Working predominantly on the upper deck, Ted had a '
             "bird\\'s eye view of the action unfolding around him.  \\n \\n "

             'activity and we just went in and anchored up and as soon as we '
             'got there, more or less, we opened fire."  As one of the larger '
             'warships present on D-Day, HMS Belfast also had a fully equipped '
             'sick bay staffed by surgeons and took hundreds of casualties on '
             'board during the first day of fighting.  After destroying the '
             'German defence batteries, the crew was tasked with clearing the '
             'beach and bringing wounded soldiers back to the ship to receive '
             'medical treatment.  Ted was trained to operate one of '
             "Belfast\\'s two cranes, which allowed him to lift stretchers up "
             'on to the deck.  \\n \\n  ![D-Day landing '

             'memory. These men were wounded. We put them on the stretcher. '
             "You\\'d then put them on a cart and get them down the beach and "
             'then put them on a pontoon on the beach.  "And then they would '
             "be taken out to the boat. And I\\'d lift those men out... and "
             'the injuries I saw, I couldn\\\'t tell you."  Fighting back '
             'tears, he adds: "There was nothing I could do about it. I looked '
             'down at them, and I cried.  "I\\\'m a soft sod. You would never '
             'believe what they went through. Those poor men.  "They took them '
             "to the sick bay, and if 2% or 3% of them survived I\\'d be "

             'was almost continuously in action over the five weeks after '
             'D-Day and fired thousands of rounds from her guns in support of '
             'Allied troops fighting their way inland.  But D-Day was not the '
             'only battle Ted fought in during his time onboard HMS Belfast.  '
             "Between 1943 and 1944, he took part in some of the navy\\'s most "
             'intense and dangerous operations including the Arctic Convoys '

             'man for the navy when he stood on the upper deck of HMS Belfast '
             'and looked helplessly on as dozens of men drowned around him.**  '
             "D-Day, on June 6 1944, was the world\\'s largest seaborne "
             'assault and the beginning of the Allied invasion of '
             'Nazi-occupied Europe.  But many of the first troops to arrive at '
             'Normandy, in northern France, were accidentally dropped off by '
             'their landing boats in too-deep water, where they sank under the '
             'weight of their guns and equipment.  Others suffered from '
             'seasickness caused by the flat bottoms on the smaller boats '
             '"bouncing" across the waves.  Speaking to the BBC from his home '
             'in Oxford, Ted, now 95, vividly remembers the events of that day '
             '75 years ago and says the horrific things he witnessed will stay '
             'with him forever.  He says: "I felt so sorry for the men. They '
             'were coming from a fair way out to get to the beach, and they '
             'were all in their uniforms and carrying guns and their own food, '
             'so they all had these cans weighing them down.  "I looked at '
             'them as we were passing them and I thought to myself, if '
             "you\\'re seasick and you\\'re then expected to get off the boat "
             'and start fighting… come on.  "The water was a bit choppy, which '
             "made no difference to us, but if you\\'re in a flat bottom boat "
             'and its a bit choppy you can really feel it.  "What those men '
             "went through. It\\'s asking a lot isn\\'t it? I think so. Those "
             'men are bloody marvellous.  "So many of them didn\\\'t make it '
             'because they were dropped too far from the land. They went '
             'straight in the deep water and drowned."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n '

             'dawn over the English Channel. More than 6,330 boats carrying '
             'thousands of men readied themselves to launch the invasion of '
             'Nazi-occupied Europe.  The night before, Ted and his fellow crew '
             'were told they were joining a large operation, but they had no '
             'idea of the scale until they saw the other ships.  But they were '
             'not nervous. Ted says: "Well, you see, once you\\\'ve gone to '
             "sea you\\'ve always got to be ready for action, U-boats, "
             'anything.  "It\\\'s like everything, you go into something '

             'Bombardment Force E, supporting troops landing at Gold and Juno '
             'beaches by attacking German defences.  The ship came under '
             'occasional fire from German artillery and dive-bombers but '
             'managed to battle on unscathed as it continued to hit German '
             'positions.  Working predominantly on the upper deck, Ted had a '
             "bird\\'s eye view of the action unfolding around him.  \\n \\n "

             'warships present on D-Day, HMS Belfast also had a fully equipped '
             'sick bay staffed by surgeons and took hundreds of casualties on '
             'board during the first day of fighting.  After destroying the '
             'German defence batteries, the crew was tasked with clearing the '
             'beach and bringing wounded soldiers back to the ship to receive '
             'medical treatment.  Ted was trained to operate one of '

             'seats in Scotland - more than all the other parties added '
             'together. That, they say, has always been the definition of '
             'victory.  But it knows that it lost a lot last night. Some of '
             'its best known and most effective MPs. And most of their '
             "political momentum.  It\\'s almost impossible for the party to "
             'now argue that the people of Scotland want another Scottish '
             'referendum when 60% of the electorate voted for parties which '
             'have vowed to block another vote on independence.  A very '
             'sombre-looking Nicola Sturgeon said last night she and the party '
             'would now need to reflect on what this result means for '
             "indyref2. But you don\\'t have to think very long or very hard "
             'to realise it now looks very unlikely to happen.  Inside the SNP '
             'members will also now have to consider whether their call for '
             'another referendum back in March was a tactical blunder. Even '
             'though they did not know at the time that there would be a '
             'general election.  Deputy First Minster John Swinney has said '
             'this morning: "We will take time and care to reflect on the '
             'outcome of this result. But we have to acknowledge that the '
             'question of a second independence referendum was a significant '
             'motivator of votes against the SNP in this election, and we have '
             'to be attentive to that point."  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n '

             'referendum when 60% of the electorate voted for parties which '

             'though they did not know at the time that there would be a '
             'general election.  Deputy First Minster John Swinney has said '

             "exploitation\\'  The internet has removed some of the "
             'psychological barriers and dangers of engaging with '
             'prostitutes.  "The growth of the internet has expanded the '
             'marketplace dramatically," says Val Richey, senior deputy '
             'prosecuting attorney for King County, a region that covers the '
             'city of Seattle.  "We found over 130 websites where you can buy '
             'sex in the Seattle area alone. One of those websites was '
             'averaging 34,000 ads a month last year.  "Our experience has '
             'been that there are hundreds and hundreds of people in our area '
             'being exploited, and we think there are up to 300-500 children '
             'being exploited at any one time."  One effective way of tackling '
             'the crisis has been to re-insert those psychological barriers, '
             'forcing morality into the minds of men with a reminder that what '
             "they\\'re trying to do is wrong.  But this approach is extremely "
             'resource-intensive, often requiring specialists to engage '
             'one-on-one with the "John".  "We know that there are thousands '
             'of buyers online at any time of the day or night," Mr Richey '
             'says.  "When we post a fake ad, we\\\'ll get 250 responses in '
             "the first two hours. There\\'s no way that law enforcement has "
             'the capacity to respond to that.  "The chat bot allows us to '
             'connect with and deter all of those buyers online at any time. '
             'We\\\'ve never been able to do that."  ## Lifelike responses  '
             'The challenge for developers was to make sure this chatbot was '
             'authentic. Any unusual behaviour, or nonsensical response, would '
             'tip off the target.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '
             'Image caption\\n \\n Real Escape from the Sex Trade (Rest) '
             'offers support to women who want to leave prostitution behind\\n '
             '\\n \\n \\n  "We work with survivors of trafficking to ask them '
             'how a conversation like this would go," explains Mr Beiser.  '
             "It\\'s the small touches that help here. Replies aren\\'t "
             "instant. There is sloppy, bad English. It\\'s by no means "
             "perfect, but during the bot\\'s test phase earlier this year, "
             '1,500 people interacted with the bot long enough to receive the '
             'deterrence message - a remarkable completion rate given the bot '
             'will ask for a selfie of the buyer as part of that '
             'conversation.  As more people use the bot, the smarter it could '
             'potentially become. The project has the backing of Microsoft, '
             'one of the tech firms leading the way on natural language '
             "research.  The bot isn\\'t being used to arrest buyers, but that "
             'could be one application in future, Mr Beiser says.  ## On '
             'Aurora  The second part of efforts here is about helping women '
             'get out of the life. To learn more about that, I visited Aurora '
             "Avenue. To an unknowing eye, it\\'s not immediately obvious what "
             'happens here.  But as Amanda Hightower begins pointing things '
             'out, the telltale signs are everywhere, such as the fast food '
             'restaurant that has pimps watching out onto the street keeping '
             'tabs on "their" women.  Ms Hightower is executive director of '
             "Real Escape from the Sex Trade (Rest). The organisation\\'s aim "
             'is to provide a safe and secure path for women looking to leave '
             'prostitution. Her work includes everything from giving women '
             'shoes and clothes, to driving to a location in the dead of night '
             'to pick up a woman who has sneaked out while their pimp was not '
             "around.  Seattle\\'s red light district looks precisely how you "
             'imagine - liquor stores, cheap motels and run-down car '
             'dealerships.  As we wander up a couple of blocks, we see two '
             'women walking together. Ms Hightower asks us to point our '
             'cameras away so she can talk to them discreetly. The women '
             'listen, but only for a polite moment - they know speaking to Ms '
             'Hightower, an instantly recognisable figure with fire-red hair, '
             'could be dangerous.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '
             'copyright\\n Getty Images\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Image caption\\n '
             '\\n A new anti-sex trafficking bill seeks to prosecute websites '
             'that encourage ads selling sex\\n \\n \\n \\n  These '
             'interactions, which used to be the main way of reaching '
             'trafficked women, are becoming more rare as fewer women use '
             'Aurora Avenue as a way to attract business.  But online, the '
             'volume of ads is too overwhelming for an organisation like Rest '
             'to handle. And so, another piece of software has been developed, '
             'one that is able to spot known codewords and jargon used to '
             'evade pitifully dumb filters.  "We can use this software to '
             'scrape the phone numbers of the ads and send one mass text out '
             'to 200 women at one time," Ms Hightower tells me.  "If '
             "they\\'re in a safe place, they can respond right away.  "
             '"Otherwise they can save the message and respond at a later time '
             "when it\\'s safe to do so. It\\'s actually made it easier for us "
             'to reach more victims of trafficking than it was before."  In '
             'some cases women have contacted Rest months after the text '
             'message was sent out. In the past year, 40 women in Seattle have '
             'gone to Rest after being reached by the tool.  ## A real '
             'solution  Ms Hightower thinks the success of this technology '
             'could and should be replicated around the world, though she '
             "cautions that it\\'s not enough to just contact women - there "
             'needs to be more investment in supporting them once they have '
             'left the life. The number-scraping tool has been rolled out to '
             '12 cities and so far identified 90,000 unique phone numbers for '
             'specialists to contact.  Advocates also back new legislation to '
             'clamp down on websites that facilitate the hosting of messages '
             'advertising the sale of sex.  After a period of disagreement, '
             'and worries new laws might be too broad, the major technology '
             'companies have finally backed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers '
             'Act \\- known as Sesta.  It could mean the owners of '
             'Backpage.com, a site described by prosecutors as a "massive '
             'online brothel", could be held liable for the advertising that '
             "appears on their site. The site declined the BBC\\'s request for "
             'comment.  In the meantime, the work of Ms Hightower and others '
             'continues around the clock.  She says: "Just yesterday I had a '
             "young woman, who\\'s living in our residential programme, come "
             "up to me and she\\'s like \\'Amanda! I have a car, I have a "
             "licence, I have insurance! Like... insurance! Legit!\\'.  "
             '"Those are the moments that make it all worthwhile and seem less '
             'overwhelming, because we know we\\\'re making a difference."  '

             'sex in the Seattle area alone. One of those websites was '
             'averaging 34,000 ads a month last year.  "Our experience has '
             'been that there are hundreds and hundreds of people in our area '
             'being exploited, and we think there are up to 300-500 children '
             'being exploited at any one time."  One effective way of tackling '
             'the crisis has been to re-insert those psychological barriers, '
             'forcing morality into the minds of men with a reminder that what '
             "they\\'re trying to do is wrong.  But this approach is extremely "
             'resource-intensive, often requiring specialists to engage '
             'one-on-one with the "John".  "We know that there are thousands '
             'of buyers online at any time of the day or night," Mr Richey '
             'says.  "When we post a fake ad, we\\\'ll get 250 responses in '
             "the first two hours. There\\'s no way that law enforcement has "
             'the capacity to respond to that.  "The chat bot allows us to '
             'connect with and deter all of those buyers online at any time. '
             'We\\\'ve never been able to do that."  ## Lifelike responses  '
             'The challenge for developers was to make sure this chatbot was '
             'authentic. Any unusual behaviour, or nonsensical response, would '
             'tip off the target.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '

             'how a conversation like this would go," explains Mr Beiser.  '
             "It\\'s the small touches that help here. Replies aren\\'t "
             "instant. There is sloppy, bad English. It\\'s by no means "
             "perfect, but during the bot\\'s test phase earlier this year, "
             '1,500 people interacted with the bot long enough to receive the '
             'deterrence message - a remarkable completion rate given the bot '
             'will ask for a selfie of the buyer as part of that '
             'conversation.  As more people use the bot, the smarter it could '
             'potentially become. The project has the backing of Microsoft, '
             'one of the tech firms leading the way on natural language '
             "research.  The bot isn\\'t being used to arrest buyers, but that "
             'could be one application in future, Mr Beiser says.  ## On '
             'Aurora  The second part of efforts here is about helping women '
             'get out of the life. To learn more about that, I visited Aurora '
             "Avenue. To an unknowing eye, it\\'s not immediately obvious what "
             'happens here.  But as Amanda Hightower begins pointing things '
             'out, the telltale signs are everywhere, such as the fast food '
             'restaurant that has pimps watching out onto the street keeping '
             'tabs on "their" women.  Ms Hightower is executive director of '
             "Real Escape from the Sex Trade (Rest). The organisation\\'s aim "
             'is to provide a safe and secure path for women looking to leave '
             'prostitution. Her work includes everything from giving women '
             'shoes and clothes, to driving to a location in the dead of night '
             'to pick up a woman who has sneaked out while their pimp was not '
             "around.  Seattle\\'s red light district looks precisely how you "
             'imagine - liquor stores, cheap motels and run-down car '
             'dealerships.  As we wander up a couple of blocks, we see two '
             'women walking together. Ms Hightower asks us to point our '
             'cameras away so she can talk to them discreetly. The women '
             'listen, but only for a polite moment - they know speaking to Ms '
             'Hightower, an instantly recognisable figure with fire-red hair, '
             'could be dangerous.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image '

             '\\n A new anti-sex trafficking bill seeks to prosecute websites '
             'that encourage ads selling sex\\n \\n \\n \\n  These '
             'interactions, which used to be the main way of reaching '
             'trafficked women, are becoming more rare as fewer women use '
             'Aurora Avenue as a way to attract business.  But online, the '
             'volume of ads is too overwhelming for an organisation like Rest '
             'to handle. And so, another piece of software has been developed, '
             'one that is able to spot known codewords and jargon used to '
             'evade pitifully dumb filters.  "We can use this software to '
             'scrape the phone numbers of the ads and send one mass text out '
             'to 200 women at one time," Ms Hightower tells me.  "If '
             "they\\'re in a safe place, they can respond right away.  "
             '"Otherwise they can save the message and respond at a later time '
             "when it\\'s safe to do so. It\\'s actually made it easier for us "
             'to reach more victims of trafficking than it was before."  In '
             'some cases women have contacted Rest months after the text '
             'message was sent out. In the past year, 40 women in Seattle have '
             'gone to Rest after being reached by the tool.  ## A real '
             'solution  Ms Hightower thinks the success of this technology '
             'could and should be replicated around the world, though she '
             "cautions that it\\'s not enough to just contact women - there "
             'needs to be more investment in supporting them once they have '
             'left the life. The number-scraping tool has been rolled out to '
             '12 cities and so far identified 90,000 unique phone numbers for '
             'specialists to contact.  Advocates also back new legislation to '
             'clamp down on websites that facilitate the hosting of messages '
             'advertising the sale of sex.  After a period of disagreement, '
             'and worries new laws might be too broad, the major technology '
             'companies have finally backed the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers '
             'Act \\- known as Sesta.  It could mean the owners of '
             'Backpage.com, a site described by prosecutors as a "massive '
             'online brothel", could be held liable for the advertising that '
             "appears on their site. The site declined the BBC\\'s request for "
             'comment.  In the meantime, the work of Ms Hightower and others '
             'continues around the clock.  She says: "Just yesterday I had a '
             "young woman, who\\'s living in our residential programme, come "
             "up to me and she\\'s like \\'Amanda! I have a car, I have a "
             "licence, I have insurance! Like... insurance! Legit!\\'.  "
             '"Those are the moments that make it all worthwhile and seem less '
             'overwhelming, because we know we\\\'re making a difference."  '

             'The US authorities have charged the two founders of '
             'Backpage.com, a website that carried sex ads, as well as five '
             'others employed by the firm.  The accusations include '
             'facilitating prostitution and money laundering.  Law officers '
             "had already taken control of Backpage\\'s various international "
             'classifieds pages last week.  The lawyer for one of the '
             'co-founders said the charges were "baseless" and the seizure of '
             'the site a "massive assault" on free speech laws.  The '
             'Dallas-based company had previously shut down the adult section '
             'of its US site, but critics had alleged that sex-related ads had '
             'simply moved to other pages.  The UK edition had carried dozens '
             'of sex service ads at the time of its closure, according to '
             "Reuters.  An investigation by the news agency\\'s philanthropic "
             'foundation had suggested that as many as one in 20 of the '
             'relevant posts on Backpage.co.uk could have involved slavery '
             'victims.  Details of the charges had been sealed until Monday by '
             'an Arizona court,.  The documents include details of 17 alleged '
             'victims said to have been trafficked via Backpage, the youngest '
             'of whom was 14 years old.  Some of the women are said to have '
             'been murdered.  "For far too long, Backpage.com existed as the '
             'dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where '
             'sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults '
             'alike," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.  One '
             "charity said the site\\'s closure only partially addressed the "
             'issue.  "Whilst efforts to close websites such as Backpage are '
             'welcome, they are a small part of a wider, complex system of '
             'sexual exploitation operating in the UK and beyond," Josephine '
             'Knowles, co-director of Beyond the Streets, told the BBC.  "A '
             'strategic approach which tackles prevention of demand and '
             'support for those wanting to exit and find genuine alternatives '
             'is desperately needed for long- term change."  ## New law  The '
             'Californian authorities had previously attempted to close '
             "Backpage.com in 2016, when the state prosecuted the business\\'s "
             'chief executive and two ex- owners over claims they had '
             'committed pimping offences and generated millions of dollars by '
             'hosting sex trade ads.  However, the case was dismissed on the '
             "grounds that the US\\'s Communications Decency Act said that "
             'publishers should not be held responsible for content created '
             'solely by their users.  But last month, Congress passed a new '
             'law, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex '
             'Trafficking Act (Fosta). It states that "websites that '
             'facilitate traffickers in advertising the sale of unlawful sex '
             'acts" should no longer be granted the same protection.  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Backpage.com\\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Backpage had featured ads for room '
             'rentals and second-hand goods in addition to sex-related '
             'posts\\n \\n \\n \\n  It has been reported that President Trump '
             'will sign a Senate-approved version of the act into law this '
             'week.  Some sites have already taken counter-measures. '
             'Craigslist shut its "personals" dating section last month after '
             'reports that it featured several ads for prostitutes.  Reddit '
             'has also closed its escorts message board. And Cityvibe and '
             'Nightshift have abandoned their online services altogether.  '
             'Digital rights advocates have, however, raised concerns, '
             'suggesting the new law will "hinder online freedom of '
             'expression".  Prostitutes have also raised concern that sites '
             'such as Backpage offered them a safer alternative to trying to '
             'find clients on the streets.  ## Child abuse  A Senate '
             'investigation had claimed in 2017 that Backpage.com had '
             '"knowingly concealed evidence of criminality" by using software '
             'to identify words and phrases in submitted adverts that were '
             'associated with child abuse.  Rather than barring the users who '
             'had submitted the ads, it was claimed, they were allowed to '
             'resubmit the posts with the restricted terms removed.  The site '
             'defended itself at the time saying it had spent "thousands of '
             'hours and millions of dollars" to help the police tackle the '
             'problem, and claimed that its efforts had helped rescue '
             'trafficked children and led to the arrest of their pimps.  The '
             'site later faced further controversy the same year when the '
             "Washington Post reported that one of Backpage\\'s contractors "
             'had attempted to lure sex- related ads away from rival sites in '
             'the Philippines by offering free postings as an incentive.  '
             'Backpage denied knowingly having facilitated sex trafficking.  '

             "had already taken control of Backpage\\'s various international "
             'classifieds pages last week.  The lawyer for one of the '
             'co-founders said the charges were "baseless" and the seizure of '
             'the site a "massive assault" on free speech laws.  The '
             'Dallas-based company had previously shut down the adult section '
             'of its US site, but critics had alleged that sex-related ads had '
             'simply moved to other pages.  The UK edition had carried dozens '
             'of sex service ads at the time of its closure, according to '
             "Reuters.  An investigation by the news agency\\'s philanthropic "
             'foundation had suggested that as many as one in 20 of the '
             'relevant posts on Backpage.co.uk could have involved slavery '
             'victims.  Details of the charges had been sealed until Monday by '
             'an Arizona court,.  The documents include details of 17 alleged '
             'victims said to have been trafficked via Backpage, the youngest '
             'of whom was 14 years old.  Some of the women are said to have '
             'been murdered.  "For far too long, Backpage.com existed as the '
             'dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where '
             'sex traffickers frequently advertised children and adults '
             'alike," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.  One '
             "charity said the site\\'s closure only partially addressed the "
             'issue.  "Whilst efforts to close websites such as Backpage are '
             'welcome, they are a small part of a wider, complex system of '
             'sexual exploitation operating in the UK and beyond," Josephine '
             'Knowles, co-director of Beyond the Streets, told the BBC.  "A '
             'strategic approach which tackles prevention of demand and '
             'support for those wanting to exit and find genuine alternatives '
             'is desperately needed for long- term change."  ## New law  The '
             'Californian authorities had previously attempted to close '
             "Backpage.com in 2016, when the state prosecuted the business\\'s "
             'chief executive and two ex- owners over claims they had '
             'committed pimping offences and generated millions of dollars by '
             'hosting sex trade ads.  However, the case was dismissed on the '
             "grounds that the US\\'s Communications Decency Act said that "
             'publishers should not be held responsible for content created '
             'solely by their users.  But last month, Congress passed a new '
             'law, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex '
             'Trafficking Act (Fosta). It states that "websites that '
             'facilitate traffickers in advertising the sale of unlawful sex '
             'acts" should no longer be granted the same protection.  \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n Image copyright\\n Backpage.com\\n \\n \\n '
             '\\n \\n Image caption\\n \\n Backpage had featured ads for room '
             'rentals and second-hand goods in addition to sex-related '
             'posts\\n \\n \\n \\n  It has been reported that President Trump '
             'will sign a Senate-approved version of the act into law this '
             'week.  Some sites have already taken counter-measures. '
             'Craigslist shut its "personals" dating section last month after '
             'reports that it featured several ads for prostitutes.  Reddit '
             'has also closed its escorts message board. And Cityvibe and '
             'Nightshift have abandoned their online services altogether.  '
             'Digital rights advocates have, however, raised concerns, '
             'suggesting the new law will "hinder online freedom of '
             'expression".  Prostitutes have also raised concern that sites '
             'such as Backpage offered them a safer alternative to trying to '
             'find clients on the streets.  ## Child abuse  A Senate '
             'investigation had claimed in 2017 that Backpage.com had '
             '"knowingly concealed evidence of criminality" by using software '
             'to identify words and phrases in submitted adverts that were '
             'associated with child abuse.  Rather than barring the users who '
             'had submitted the ads, it was claimed, they were allowed to '
             'resubmit the posts with the restricted terms removed.  The site '
             'defended itself at the time saying it had spent "thousands of '
             'hours and millions of dollars" to help the police tackle the '
             'problem, and claimed that its efforts had helped rescue '
             'trafficked children and led to the arrest of their pimps.  The '
             'site later faced further controversy the same year when the '
             "Washington Post reported that one of Backpage\\'s contractors "
             'had attempted to lure sex- related ads away from rival sites in '
             'the Philippines by offering free postings as an incentive.  '
             'Backpage denied knowingly having facilitated sex trafficking.  '

             'Father-of-four Jason Gregory, 44, died from a heart attack after '
             'a fight in Vernon Walk, Southampton on 6 May 2017.  Security '
             'guards had made a radio call to Southampton Citywatch to request '
             '"urgent police attendance".  However, according to a report this '
             'was refused, which led to a delay in getting medical help for Mr '
             'Gregory.  According to the report by Grahame Short, senior '
             'coroner for Southampton and the New Forest, Mr Gregory was '
             'restrained by at least two door security staff and was held '
             'around his neck for part of the time.  When they contacted the '
             'Citywatch CCTV control room for back-up, they were told to call '
             "999 instead.  ## \\'Brain damage\\'  The report concluded Mr "
             "Gregory\\'s cardiac arrest was likely to have been caused by the "
             '"combined and delayed effects" of neck compression, Mr Gregory '
             'resisting being restrained and alcohol and drugs intoxication.  '
             'Coroner Mr Short said: "Jason Gregory died due to the fact that '
             'he was restrained in an inappropriate manner after behaving '
             'aggressively in a public place whilst being intoxicated.  "There '
             'was a delay before he received the urgent medical treatment he '
             'required, during which time he suffered irreversible hypoxic '
             'brain damage."  Mr Short said he was concerned that in an '
             'emergency situation, during busy times, details were not being '
             'relayed to Hampshire police by the Citywatch control room in a '
